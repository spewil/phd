How does this document work?

Here is general stuff about the page. Below that add "mdmerge" CLI links to transclude other markdown documents into this one, similar to latex chapters/includes.

Then we run compile, a python script that invokes pypandoc, which adds a header and puts it all into a template which references pandoc.css

TODO:
	- make the layout more small-screen friendly (rearrange the TOC)
	- think about how to include footnotes in the sidebar? (tufte pandoc css)
		- combine tufte template with fixed table of contents (maybe on the left?)
	- how do we output to pdf?
