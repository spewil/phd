  abstract = {The current dominant paradigm in sensorimotor control, whether imitation or reinforcement learning, is to train policies directly in raw action spaces. This forces the agent to make decisions at each point in training, and limits scalability to complex tasks. In contrast, classical robotics research has exploited dynamical systems as policy representations to learn behaviors via demonstrations. These techniques, however, lack the flexibility provided by deep learning and have remained under-explored in such settings. In this work, we begin to close this gap and embed dynamics structure into deep neural network-based policies by reparameterizing action spaces with differential equations. We propose Neural Dynamic Policies (NDPs) that make predictions in trajectory distribution space as opposed to raw control spaces. The embedded structure allows us to perform end-to-end policy learning in both reinforcement and imitation learning setups. We show that NDPs achieve state-of-the-art performance on many robotic control tasks in simulation, as well as on digit writing using demonstrations.},

  abstract = {Whether the nervous system relies on modularity to simplify acquisition and control of complex motor skills remains controversial. To date, evidence for modularity has been indirect, based on statistical regularities in the motor commands captured by muscle synergies. Here we provide direct evidence by testing the prediction that in a truly modular controller it must be harder to adapt to perturbations that are incompatible with the modules. We investigated a reaching task in which human subjects used myoelectric control to move a mass in a virtual environment. In this environment we could perturb the normal muscle-to-force mapping, as in a complex surgical rearrangement of the tendons, by altering the mapping between recorded muscle activity and simulated force applied on the mass. After identifying muscle synergies, we performed two types of virtual surgeries. After compatible virtual surgeries, a full range of movements could still be achieved recombining the synergies, whereas after incompatible virtual surgeries, new or modified synergies would be required. Adaptation rates after the two types of surgery were compared. If synergies were only a parsimonious description of the regularities in the muscle patterns generated by a nonmodular controller, we would expect adaptation rates to be similar, as both types of surgeries could be compensated with similar changes in the muscle patterns. In contrast, as predicted by modularity, we found strikingly faster adaptation after compatible surgeries than after incompatible ones. These results indicate that muscle synergies are key elements of a modular architecture underlying motor control and adaptation.},

Muscle synergies may be used to characterize multimuscle pattern organization irrespective of time (spatial synergies), in time irrespective of the muscles (temporal synergies), and both across muscles and in time (spatiotemporal synergies). The decomposition of muscle patterns as combinations of different types of muscle synergies offers the possibility to identify specific changes due to neurological lesions. In this study, we recorded electromyographic activity from 13 shoulder and arm muscles in subjects with cerebellar ataxias (CA) and in age-matched healthy subjects (HS) while they performed reaching movements in multiple directions. We assessed whether cerebellar damage affects the organization of muscle patterns by extracting different types of muscle synergies from the muscle patterns of each HS and using these synergies to reconstruct the muscle patterns of all other participants. We found that CA muscle patterns could be accurately captured only by spatial muscle synergies of HS. In contrast, there were significant differences in the reconstruction R               2               values for both spatiotemporal and temporal synergies, with an interaction between the two synergy types indicating a larger difference for spatiotemporal synergies.

  abstract = {How is an evanescent wish to move translated into a concrete action? This simple question and puzzling miracle remains a focal point of motor systems neuroscience. Where does the difficulty lie? A great deal has been known about biomechanics for quite some time. More recently, there have been significant advances in our understanding of how the spinal system is organized into modules corresponding to spinal synergies, which are fixed patterns of multimuscle recruitment. But much less is known about how the supraspinal system recruits these synergies in the correct spatiotemporal pattern to effectively control movement. We argue that what makes the problem of supraspinal control so difficult is that it emerges as a result of multiple convergent and redundant sensorimotor loops. Because these loops are convergent, multiple modes of information are mixed before being sent to the spinal system; because they are redundant, information is overlapping such that a mechanism must exist to eliminate the redundancy before the signal is sent to the spinal system. Given these complex interactions, simple correlation analyses between movement variables and neural activity are likely to render a confusing and inconsistent picture. Here, we suggest that the perspective of sensorimotor loops might help in achieving a better systems-level understanding. Furthermore, state-of-the-art techniques in neurotechnology, such as optogenetics, appear to be well suited for investigating the problem of motor control at the level of loops.},

  abstract = {At face value, the term ``synergy'' provides a unifying concept within a fractured field that encompasses complementary neural, computational, and behavioral approaches. However, the term is not used synonymously by different researchers but has substantially different meanings depending on the research approach. With so many operational definitions for the one term, it becomes difficult to use as either a descriptive or explanatory concept, yet it remains pervasive and apparently indispensable. Here we provide a summary of different approaches that invoke synergies in a descriptive or explanatory context, summarizing progress, not within the one approach, but across the theoretical landscape. Bernstein's framework of flexible hierarchical control may provide a unifying framework here, since it can incorporate divergent ideas about synergies. In the current motor control literature, synergy may refer to conceptually different processes that could potentially operate in parallel, across different levels within the same hierarchical control scheme. There is evidence for the concurrent existence of synergies with different features, both ``hard-wired'' and ``soft-wired,'' and task independent and task dependent. By providing a comprehensive overview of the multifaceted ideas about synergies, our goal is to move away from the compartmentalization and narrow the focus on one level and promote a broader perspective on the control and coordination of movement.},

The many degrees of freedom of the musculoskeletal apparatus provide great flexibility but make the control problem extremely complex. Muscle synergies--coherent activations, in space or time, of a group of muscles--have been proposed as building blocks that could simplify the construction of motor behaviors. To evaluate this hypothesis, we developed a new method to extract invariant spatiotemporal components from the simultaneous recordings of the activity of many muscles. We used this technique to analyze the muscle patterns of intact and unrestrained frogs during kicking, a natural defensive behavior. Here we show that combinations of three time-varying muscle synergies underlie the variety of muscle patterns required to kick in different directions, that the recruitment of these synergies is related to movement kinematics, and that there are similarities among the synergies extracted from different behaviors.},

We propose a multi-stage procedure, called Coarse-ID control, that estimates a model from a few experimental trials, estimates the error in that model with respect to the truth, and then designs a controller using both the model and uncertainty estimate. Our technique uses contemporary tools from random matrix theory to bound the error in the estimation procedure. We also employ a recently developed approach to control synthesis called System Level Synthesis that enables robust control design by solving a quasiconvex optimization problem. We provide end-to-end bounds on the relative error in control cost that are optimal in the number of parameters and that highlight salient properties of the system to be controlled such as closed-loop sensitivity and optimal control magnitude. We show experimentally that the Coarse-ID approach enables efficient computation of a stabilizing controller in regimes where simple control schemes that do not take the model uncertainty into account fail to stabilize the true system.},

  abstract = {When sharing load among multiple muscles, humans appear to select an optimal pattern of activation that minimizes costs such as the effort or variability of movement. How the nervous system achieves this behavior, however, is unknown. Here we show that contrary to predictions from optimal control theory, habitual muscle activation patterns are surprisingly robust to changes in limb biomechanics. We first developed a method to simulate joint forces in real time from electromyographic recordings of the wrist muscles. When the model was altered to simulate the effects of paralyzing a muscle, the subjects simply increased the recruitment of all muscles to accomplish the task, rather than recruiting only the useful muscles. When the model was altered to make the force output of one muscle unusually noisy, the subjects again persisted in recruiting all muscles rather than eliminating the noisy one. Such habitual coordination patterns were also unaffected by real modifications of biomechanics produced by selectively damaging a muscle without affecting sensory feedback. Subjects naturally use different patterns of muscle contraction to produce the same forces in different pronation-supination postures, but when the simulation was based on a posture different from the actual posture, the recruitment patterns tended to agree with the actual rather than the simulated posture. The results appear inconsistent with computation of motor programs by an optimal controller in the brain. Rather, the brain may learn and recall command programs that result in muscle coordination patterns generated by lower sensorimotor circuitry that are functionally "good-enough."},

The objective of this study was to compare the use of muscles appropriate for partial-hand prostheses with those typically used for complete hand devices and to determine whether differences in their underlying neural substrates translate to different levels of myoelectric control. Approach. We developed a novel abstract myoelectric decoder based on motor learning. Three muscle pairs, namely, an intrinsic and independent, an intrinsic and synergist and finally, an extrinsic and antagonist, were tested during abstract myoelectric control. Feedback conditions probed the roles of feed-forward and feedback mechanisms. Results. Both performance levels and rates of improvement were significantly higher for intrinsic hand muscles relative to muscles of the forearm. Intrinsic hand muscles showed considerable improvement generalising to decoder use without visual feedback. Results indicate that visual feedback from the decoder is used for transitioning between muscle activity levels, but not for maintaining state. Both individual and group performance were found to be strongly related to motor variability. Significance. Physiological differences inherent to the hand muscles can translate to improved prosthesis control. Our results support the use of motor learning based techniques for upper-limb myoelectric control and strongly argues for their utility in control of partial-hand prostheses. We provide evidence of myoelectric control skill acquisition and offer a formal definition for abstract decoding in the context of prosthetic control.},

However, its application to the investigation of motor control systems in nonhuman primates is rather limited, because optogenetic stimulation of cortical neurons in nonhuman primates has failed to induce or modulate any hand/arm movements. Here, we used a tetracycline-inducible gene expression system carrying CaMKII promoter and the gene encoding a Channelrhodopsin-2 variant with fast kinetics in the common marmoset, a small New World monkey. In an awake state, forelimb movements could be induced when Channelrhodopsin-2-expressing neurons in the motor cortex were illuminated by blue laser light with a spot diameter of 1 mm or 2 mm through a cranial window without cortical invasion. Forelimb muscles responded 10 ms to 50 ms after photostimulation onset. Long-duration (500 ms) photostimulation induced discrete forelimb movements that could be markerlessly tracked with charge-coupled device cameras and a deep learning algorithm. Long-duration photostimulation mapping revealed that the primary motor cortex is divided into multiple domains that can induce hand and elbow movements in different directions. During performance of a forelimb movement task, movement trajectories were modulated by weak photostimulation, which did not induce visible forelimb movements at rest, around the onset of task-relevant movement. The modulation was biased toward the movement direction induced by the strong photostimulation. Combined with calcium imaging, all-optical interrogation of motor circuits should be possible in behaving marmosets.},

Hand motor units are not readily categorized into the classical physiological types as established in the cat gastrocnemius muscle. In addition, the distribution of descending synaptic inputs to motor nuclei supplying different hand muscles is outlined. Motor neurons innervating intrinsic muscles appear to have relatively independent lines of input from supraspinal centres whereas substantial divergence of descending input is seen across motor nuclei supplying extrinsic hand muscles. The functional significance of such differential organizations of descending inputs for the control of hand movements is discussed.},

  abstract = {Piano performance involves a large repertoire of highly skilled movements. The acquisition of these exceptional skills despite innate neural and biomechanical constraints requires a sophisticated interaction between plasticity of the neural system and organization of a redundant number of degrees of freedom (DOF) in the motor system. Neuroplasticity subserving virtuosity of pianists has been documented in neuroimaging studies investigating effects of long-term piano training on structure and function of the cortical and subcortical regions. By contrast, recent behavioral studies have advanced the understanding of neuromuscular strategies and biomechanical principles behind the movement organization that enables skilled piano performance. Here we review the motor control and biomechanics literature, introducing the importance of describing motor behaviors not only for understanding mechanisms responsible for skillful motor actions in piano playing, but also for advancing diagnosis and rehabilitation of movement disorders caused by extensive piano practice.},

Di-mensionality reduction methods reveal a striking simplicity underlying such multi-neuronal data: they can be reduced to a low-dimensional space, and the resulting neural trajectories in this space yield a remarkably insightful dynamical portrait of circuit computation. This simplicity raises profound and timely conceptual questions. What are its origins and its implications for the complexity of neural dynamics? How would the situation change if we recorded more neurons? When, if at all, can we trust dynamical portraits obtained from measuring an infinitesimal fraction of task relevant neurons? We present a theory that answers these questions, and test it using physiological recordings from reaching monkeys. This theory reveals conceptual insights into how task complexity governs both neural dimensionality and accurate recovery of dynamic portraits, thereby providing quantitative guidelines for future large-scale experimental design.},

This can be shown in many synergy-based MP frameworks [24]. These same types of pulsed synergies are seen in mammals. Such synergy pulses have also been described in mammalian fictive preparations during locomotion, where they can be spontaneously deleted from the neural output, without affecting the underlying rhythm generation [25]. This observation of fictive synergy deletion without rhythm change in the cat has led McCrea and Rybak to propose the separation of rhythm generation and pattern shaping in the tetrapod locomotor pattern generation systems [26 ], and see [27]. Synergy bursts are also seen in intact locomotion by Drew and colleagues and used in accounts of its adjustments [28,29]. These architectural insights have helped structure thought about limb control systems, interlimb integration and limb trunk integration with descending controls and volition in animal model systems for locomotion.},

Each stimulation train was 500 ms in duration, approximating the time scale of normal reaching and grasping movements and the time scale of the neuronal activity that normally accompanies movement. This stimulation on a behaviorally relevant time scale evoked coordinated, complex postures that involved many joints. For example, stimulation of one site caused the mouth to open and also caused the hand to shape into a grip posture and move to the mouth. Stimulation of this site always drove the joints toward this final posture, regardless of the direction of movement required to reach the posture. Stimulation of other cortical sites evoked different postures. Postures that involved the arm were arranged across cortex to form a map of hand positions around the body. This stimulation-evoked map encompassed both primary motor and the adjacent premotor cortex. We suggest that these regions fit together into a single map of the workspace around the body.},

In this study, we examined these movements in detail and tested whether they showed adaptability to differing circumstances such as to a weight added to the hand. Electrical microstimulation was applied to motor cortex using pulse trains of 500-ms duration (matching the approximate duration of a reach). Arm movement was measured using a high-resolution three-dimensional tracking system. Movement latencies averaged 80.2 ms. Speed profiles were typically smooth and bell-shaped, and the peak speed covaried with movement distance. Stimulation generally evoked a specific final hand position. The convergence of the hand from disparate starting positions to a narrow range of final positions was statistically significant for every site tested (91/91). When a weight was fixed to the hand, for some stimulation sites (74\%), the evoked movement appeared to compensate for the weight in that the hand was lifted to a similar final location. For other stimulation sites (26\%), the weight caused a significant reduction in final hand height. For about one-half of the sites (54\%), the variation in movement of each joint appeared to compensate for the variation in the other joints in a manner that stabilized the hand in a restricted region of space. These findings suggest that at least some of the stimulation-evoked movements reflect relatively high-level, adaptable motor plans.},

  abstract = {Motor cortex in the primate brain was once thought to contain a simple map of the body's muscles. Recent evidence suggests, however, that it operates at a radically more complex level, coordinating behaviorally useful actions. Specific subregions of motor cortex may emphasize different ethologically relevant categories of behavior, such as interactions between the hand and the mouth, reaching motions, or defensive maneuvers to protect the body surface from impending impact. Single neurons in motor cortex may contribute to these behaviors by means of their broad tuning to idiosyncratic, multijoint actions. The mapping from cortex to muscles is not fixed, as was once thought, but instead is fluid, changing continuously on the basis of feedback in a manner that could support the control of higher-order movement parameters. These findings suggest that the motor cortex participates directly in organizing and controlling the animal's behavioral repertoire.},

They are one of the few sources of descending commands that directly influence motor output. We examined the contribution of CM cells to the generation of activity in their target muscles. The preferred direction of many CM cells differed from that of their target muscles. Some CM cells were selectively active when a muscle was used as an agonist. Others were selectively active when the same muscle was used as a synergist, fixator, or antagonist. These observations suggest that the different functional uses of a muscle are generated by separate populations of CM cells.

  abstract = {Nonlinear dynamical systems have been used in many disciplines to model complex behaviors, including biological motor control, robotics, perception, economics, traffic prediction, and neuroscience. While often the unexpected emergent behavior of nonlinear systems is the focus of investigations, it is of equal importance to create goal-directed behavior (e.g., stable locomotion from a system of coupled oscillators under perceptual guidance). Modeling goal-directed behavior with nonlinear systems is, however, rather difficult due to the parameter sensitivity of these systems, their complex phase transitions in response to subtle parameter changes, and the difficulty of analyzing and predicting their long-term behavior; intuition and time-consuming parameter tuning play a major role. This letter presents and reviews dynamical movement primitives, a line of research for modeling attractor behaviors of autonomous nonlinear dynamical systems with the help of statistical learning techniques. The essence of our approach is to start with a simple dynamical system, such as a set of linear differential equations, and transform those into a weakly nonlinear system with prescribed attractor dynamics by means of a learnable autonomous forcing term. Both point attractors and limit cycle attractors of almost arbitrary complexity can be generated. We explain the design principle of our approach and evaluate its properties in several example applications in motor control and robotics.},

We discuss how contributions tamed the complexity of the domain and study the role of algorithms, representations, and prior knowledge in achieving these successes.

Our analysis quantifies the tension between policy improvement and policy evaluation, and suggests that policy evaluation is the dominant factor in terms of sample complexity. Specifically, we show that to obtain a controller that is within {$\epsilon$} of the optimal LQR controller, each step of policy evaluation requires at most (n + d)3/{$\epsilon$}2 samples, where n is the dimension of the state vector and d is the dimension of the input vector. On the other hand, only log(1/{$\epsilon$}) policy improvement steps suffice, resulting in an overall sample complexity of (n + d)3{$\epsilon-$}2 log(1/{$\epsilon$}). We furthermore build on our analysis and construct a simple adaptive procedure based on {$\epsilon$}-greedy exploration which relies on approximate PI as a sub-routine and obtains T 2/3 regret, improving upon a recent result of Abbasi-Yadkori et al.

This review considers recent neurophysiological evidence showing that the degree of dexterity in different nonhuman primates is reflected in the strength of the CM connections to hand motoneurons. It also shows that phylogenetically older, indirect pathways may have been superseded by the direct CM system. The unique contribution of the CM system to hand function may reside in the focused and powerful facilitation it exerts on selective groups of muscles, as shown by recordings from identified CM neurons during performance of precision grip by conscious, trained monkeys. In man, damage by stroke to the corticospinal system often results in weakness and poverty of hand movement. New evidence from the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in stroke patients demonstrates that any recovery in the voluntary activation of hand muscles is always accompanied by recovery of short-latency responses to TMS, which are probably mediated by the fast corticospinal system, suggesting that the integrity of this system is essential for recovery of hand function.},

A given pathway can have many functional roles. This review explores to what extent descending pathways are highly conserved across species and concludes that there are actually rather widespread species differences, for example, in the transmission of information from the corticospinal tract to upper limb motoneurons. The significance of direct, corticomotoneuronal (CM) connections, which were discovered a little more than 50 years ago, is reassessed. I conclude that although these connections operate in parallel with other less direct linkages to motoneurons, CM influence is significant and may subserve some special functions including adaptive motor behaviors involving the distal extremities.},

Furthermore, in the fully observed Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), our result improves upon recent work by Dean et al.

  abstract = {When performing a skill such as throwing a dart, many different combinations of joint motions suffice to hit the target. The motor system adapts rapidly to reduce bias in the desired outcome (i.e., the first-order moment of the error); however, the essence of skill is to produce movements with less variability (i.e., to reduce the second-order moment). It is easy to see how feedback about success or failure could sculpt performance to achieve this aim. However, it is unclear whether the dimensions responsible for success or failure need to be known explicitly by the subjects, or whether learning can proceed without explicit awareness of the movement parameters that need to change. Here, we designed a redundant, twodimensional reaching task in which we could selectively manipulate task success and the variability of action outcomes, whilst also manipulating awareness of the dimension along which performance could be improved. Variability was manipulated either by amplifying natural errors, leaving the correlation between the executed movement and the visual feedback intact, or by adding extrinsic noise, decorrelating movement and feedback. We found that explicit, binary, feedback about success or failure was only sufficient for learning when participants were aware of the dimension along which motor behavior had to change. Without such awareness, learning was only present when extrinsic noise was added to the feedback, but not when task success or variability was manipulated in isolation; learning was also much slower. Our results highlight the importance of conscious awareness of the relevant dimension during motor learning, and suggest that higher-order moments of outcome signals are likely to play a significant role in skill learning in complex tasks.},

The issue of how the Euclidean properties of space are represented in the nervous system is a main focus in the study of visual perception, but is equally relevant to motor learning. The goal of our experiments was to investigate how the properties of space guide the remapping of motor coordination. Subjects wore an instrumented data glove that recorded the finger motions. Signals generated by the glove operated a remotely controlled endpoint: a cursor on a computer monitor. The subjects were instructed to execute movements of this endpoint with controlled motions of the fingers. This required inverting a highly redundant map from fingers to cursor motions. We found that 1) after training with visual feedback of the final error (but not of the ongoing cursor motion), subjects learned to map cursor locations into config-urations of the fingers; 2) extended practice of movement led to more rectilinear cursor movement, a trend facilitated by training under continuous visual feedback of cursor motions; 3) with practice, subjects reduced motion in the degrees of freedom that did not contribute to the movements of the cursor; 4) with practice, subjects reduced variability of both cursor and hand movements; and 5) the reduction of errors and the increase in linearity generalized beyond the set of movements used for training. These findings suggest that subjects not only learned to produce novel coordinated movement to control the placement of the cursor, but they also developed a representation of the Euclidean space on which hand movements were remapped. I N T R O D U C T I O N The defining property of Euclidean spaces is that the length of a segment does not depend on the segment's orientation or position. This property is essential to capture the nature and motions of rigid bodies (Goldstein 1980), which are defined by the invariance of the distances between their points. The measure of distance (the metric) is of vital importance in constructing a map between the visual representation of space and the motor commands controlling movements within that space. The ability of the visual system to capture the Euclidean nature of space has been extensively studied (Hatfield 2003; Shepard 2001), whereas fewer studies have examined the representation of space in the motor system (Bernstein 1967; Rossetti 1998). These studies emphasize that visual perception and motor action are independent but highly interconnected. The visual representation of space from retinal coordinates is believed to be transformed into motor commands by dorsal pathways, whereas objects within space are thought to be represented by ventral pathways, with multiple interconnec-tions between the two pathways (Goodale and Milner 1992; Milner and Goodale 1993). In contrast, little is known about how the fundamental geometrical properties of space are rep-resented by the motor system. We easily formulate and execute motor plans such as " move the hand 10 cm to the right, " despite the fact that this action requires widely varying muscle activations and segmental coordination, depending on the hand's initial position. This clearly demonstrates that the motor system is able to capture the Euclidean properties of the space in which actions take place. The purpose of our studies was to understand how the motor system learns to represent a new space. We asked subjects to move between target locations on a computer screen using an instrumented data glove that converted finger motions into cursor motions. The screen had a well-defined Euclidean met-ric: the distance between any two points is the length of the straight segment that joins them. In contrast, there is no obvious or " natural " definition of distance in finger articulation space (i.e., between two gestures of the hand). We observed how two features of motor behavior evolved in the course of learning this novel task: 1) the shape of the cursor trajectories and 2) the variability of both hand and cursor motions. Our hypotheses centered on two questions. First, we asked whether subjects learn the Euclidean metric of the controlled endpoint by organizing coordination of finger motions to gen-erate straighter motions of the cursor (i.e., movements of minimum Euclidean length). The second question is whether practice leads to more accurate targeting, at the expense of more variable trajectories (Todorov and Jordan 2002) or, alternatively, does the entire movement profile become less variable, suggesting that the control system is attempting to become both more accurate in reaching the target and more consistent in producing finger and/or cursor trajectories (Flash and Hogan 1985; Hogan 1984)? We will show that when subjects learn to control an overabundant set of hand signals in the presence of a novel transformation between these signals and the controlled endpoint, they become both more accurate in the task and more consistent in their finger and cursor motions. This finding is not consistent with the model of motor control proposing that the motor system increases variability in the redundant degrees of freedom to improve accuracy of the motor task.},

Over its phylogenesis, CS innervation gradually invaded to the ventral spinal cord, eventually making direct connections with spinal motoneurons (MNs) in higher primates. Despite its importance, our knowledge of the origin of the direct CS-MN connections is limited; in fact, there is controversy as to whether these connections occur in subprimate mammals, such as rodents. Here we studied the retrograde transsynaptic connection between cortical neurons and MNs in mice by labeling the cells with recombinant rabies virus. On postnatal day 14 (P14), we found that CS neurons make direct connections with cervical MNs innervating the forearm muscles. Direct connections were also detected electrophysiologically in whole cell recordings from identified MNs retrogradely-labeled from their target muscles and optogenetic CS stimulation. In contrast, few, if any, lumbar MNs innervating hindlimbs showed direct connections on P18. Moreover, the direct CS-MN connections observed on P14 were later eliminated. The transient CS-MN cells were distributed predominantly in the M1 and S1 areas. These findings provide insight into the ontogeny and phylogeny of the CS projection and appear to settle the controversy about direct CS-MN connections in subprimate mammals.},

An extensive line of investigations in visual information processing has dealt with the issue of how the Euclidean properties of space are recovered from visual signals that do not appear to possess these properties. The same question is addressed here in the context of motor behavior and motor learning by observing how people remap hand gestures and body motions that control the state of an external device.

It replaces the classic nonlinear, model-based optimization with a linear approximation that softly maximizes around (and is weakly biased toward) a learned default policy. This solution exposes connections between seemingly disparate phenomena across behavioral neuroscience, notably flexible replanning with biases and cognitive control. It also gives new insight into how the brain can represent maps of long-distance contingencies stably and componentially, as in entorhinal response fields, and exploit them to guide choice even under changing goals.},

Support for this comes from spatial domain analyses (i.e., structure of) of kinematic, kinetic, and EMG variability. While proponents admit the possibility of preferential as opposed to strictly uncontrolled variables, such distinctions have only begun to be quantified or considered in the temporal domain when inferring control action. Here we extend the study of task variability during tripod static grasp to the temporal domain by applying diffusion analysis. We show that both task-relevant and task-irrelevant parameters show corrective action at some time scales; and conversely, that task-relevant parameters do not show corrective action at other time scales. That is, the spatial fluctuations of fingertip forces show, as expected, greater ranges of variability in task-irrelevant variables ({$>$}98\% associated with changes in total grasp force; vs. only {$<$}2\% in task-relevant changes associated with acceleration of the object). But at some time scales, however, temporal fluctuations of task-irrelevant variables exhibit negative correlations clearly indicative of corrective action (scaling exponents {$<$}0.5); and temporal fluctuations of task-relevant variables exhibit neutral and positive correlations clearly indicative of absence of corrective action (scaling exponents {$\geq$}0.5). In agreement with recent work in other behavioral contexts, these results propose we revise our understanding of variability vis-\'a-vis task relevance by considering both spatial and temporal features of all task variables when inferring control action and understanding how the CNS confronts task redundancy. Instead of a dichotomy of presence vs. absence of control, we should speak of a continuum of weaker to stronger\textemdash and potentially different\textemdash control strategies in specific spatiotemporal domains, indicated here by the magnitude of deviation from the 0.5 scaling exponent. Moreover, these results are counter examples to the UCM hypothesis and the Minimal Intervention principle, and the similar nature of control actions across time scales in both task-relevant and task-irrelevant spaces points to a level of modularity not previously recognized.},

To investigate the mechanisms underlying this ability, we trained subjects to move a two-dimensional cursor using a myoelectric-controlled interface. With the upper limb immobilized, an electromyogram from multiple hand and arm muscles moved the cursor in directions that were either intuitive or nonintuitive and with high or low variability. We found that subjects could learn even nonintuitive arrangements to a high level of performance. Muscle-tuning functions were cosine shaped and modulated so as to reduce cursor variability. Subjects exhibited an additional preference for using hand muscles over arm muscles, which resulted from a greater capacity of these to form novel, task-specific synergies. In a second experiment, nonvisual feedback from the hand was degraded with amplitude- and frequency-modulated vibration. Although vibration impaired task performance, it did not affect the rate at which learning occurred. We therefore conclude that the motor system can acquire internal models of novel, abstract neuromotor mappings even in the absence of overt movements or accurate proprioceptive signals, but that the distal motor system may be better suited to provide flexible control signals for neuromotor prostheses than structures related to the arm.},

In order to compare the relative merits of various techniques, it presents a case study of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) with unknown dynamics, perhaps the simplest and best-studied problem in optimal control. It also describes how merging techniques from learning theory and control can provide nonasymptotic characterizations of LQR performance and shows that these characterizations tend to match experimental behavior. In turn, when revisiting more complex applications, many of the observed phenomena in LQR persist. In particular, theory and experiment demonstrate the role and importance of models and the cost of generality in reinforcement learning algorithms. The article concludes with a discussion of some of the challenges in designing learning systems that safely and reliably interact with complex and uncertain environments and how tools from reinforcement learning and control might be combined to approach these challenges.},

  abstract = {Surface electromyography is used in research, to estimate the activity of muscle, in prosthetic design, to provide a control signal, and in biofeedback, to provide subjects with a visual or auditory indication of muscle contraction. Unfortunately, successful applications are limited by the variability in the signal and the consequent poor quality of estimates. I propose to use a nonlinear recursive filter based on Bayesian estimation. The desired filtered signal is modeled as a combined diffusion and jump process and the measured electromyographic (EMG) signal is modeled as a random process with a density in the exponential family and rate given by the desired signal. The rate is estimated on-line by calculating the full conditional density given all past measurements from a single electrode. The Bayesian estimate gives the filtered signal that best describes the observed EMG signal. This estimate yields results with very low short-time variability but also with the capability of very rapid response to change. The estimate approximates isometric joint torque with lower error and higher signal-to-noise ratio than current linear methods. Use of the nonlinear filter significantly reduces noise compared with current algorithms, and it may therefore permit more effective use of the EMG signal for prosthetic control, biofeedback, and neurophysiology research.},

More recently, the motor system has been subject to quantitative and computational characterization. The purpose of this review is to argue that the lesion approach and theoretical motor control can mutually inform each other. Specifically, one may identify distinct motor control processes from computational models and map them onto specific deficits in patients. Here we review some of the impairments in motor control, motor learning and higher-order motor control in patients with lesions of the corticospinal tract, the cerebellum, parietal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the medial temporal lobe. We attempt to explain some of these impairments in terms of computational ideas such as state estimation, optimization, prediction, cost, and reward. We suggest that a function of the cerebellum is system identification: to build internal models that predict sensory outcome of motor commands and correct motor commands through internal feedback. A function of the parietal cortex is state estimation: to integrate the predicted proprioceptive and visual outcomes with sensory feedback to form a belief about how the commands affected the states of the body and the environment. A function of basal ganglia is related to optimal control: learning costs and rewards associated with sensory states and estimating the "cost-to-go" during execution of a motor task. Finally, functions of the primary and the premotor cortices are related to implementing the optimal control policy by transforming beliefs about proprioceptive and visual states, respectively, into motor commands.},

Muscle synergies have been proposed to be the functional building blocks that coordinate such complex motor behaviors, but little is known about how they are implemented in the central nervous system. Here we demonstrate that premotor interneurons (PreM-INs) in the primate cervical spinal cord underlie the spatiotemporal patterns of hand muscle synergies during a voluntary grasping task. Using spike-triggered averaging of hand muscle activity, we found that the muscle fields of PreM-INs were not uniformly distributed across hand muscles but rather distributed as clusters corresponding to muscle synergies. Moreover, although individual PreM-INs have divergent activation patterns, the population activity of PreM-INs reflects the temporal activation of muscle synergies. These findings demonstrate that spinal PreM-INs underlie the muscle coordination required for voluntary hand movements in primates. Given the evolution of neural control of primate hand functions, we suggest that spinal premotor circuits provide the fundamental coordination of multiple joints and muscles upon which more fractionated control is achieved by superimposed, phylogenetically newer, pathways.},

To compare these hypotheses, we recorded hand postures from a range of complex manipulation task. The structure of the synergies we extracted (via PCA) was task-dependent, and their number significantly exceeded previous observations in a simpler grasping task. Our results lend support to an optimal control explanation rather than a "simplicity" explanation.},

Motivated by recent empirical success of RL on continuous control tasks, we study the sample complexity of popular model-based and model-free algorithms on the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). We show that for policy evaluation, a simple model-based plugin method requires asymptotically less samples than the classical least-squares temporal difference (LSTD) estimator to reach the same quality of solution; the sample complexity gap between the two methods can be at least a factor of state dimension. For policy optimization, we study a simple family of problem instances and show that nominal (certainty equivalence principle) control also requires several factors of state and input dimension fewer samples than the policy gradient method to reach the same level of control performance on these instances. Furthermore, the gap persists even when employing baselines commonly used in practice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical result which demonstrates a separation in the sample complexity between model-based and model-free methods on a continuous control task.},

  abstract = {Current thinking attributes information processing for neuromuscular control exclusively to the nervous system. Our cadaveric experiments and computer simulations show, however, that the tendon network of the fingers performs logic computation to preferentially change torque production capabilities. How this tendon network propagates tension to enable manipulation has been debated since the time of Vesalius and DaVinci and remains an unanswered question. We systematically changed the proportion of tension to the tendons of the extensor digitorum versus the two dorsal interosseous muscles of two cadaver fingers and measured the tension delivered to the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. We find that the distribution of input tensions in the tendon network itself regulates how tensions propagate to the finger joints, acting like the switching function of a logic gate that nonlinearly enables different torque production capabilities. Computer modeling reveals that the deformable structure of the tendon networks is responsible for this phenomenon; and that this switching behavior is an effective evolutionary solution permitting a rich repertoire of finger joint actuation not possible with simpler tendon paths. We conclude that the structural complexity of this tendon network, traditionally oversimplified or ignored, may in fact be critical to understanding brain-body coevolution and neuromuscular control. Moreover, this form of information processing at the macroscopic scale is a new instance of the emerging principle of nonneural "somatic logic" found to perform logic computation such as in cellular networks.},

  abstract = {Numerous observations of structured motor variability indicate that the sensorimotor system preferentially controls task-relevant parameters while allowing task-irrelevant ones to fluctuate. Optimality models show that controlling a redundant musculo-skeletal system in this manner meets task demands while minimizing control effort. Although this line of inquiry has been very productive, the data are mostly behavioral with no direct physiological evidence on the level of muscle or neural activity. Furthermore, biomechanical coupling, signal-dependent noise, and alternative causes of trial-to-trial variability confound behavioral studies. Here we address those confounds and present evidence that the nervous system preferentially controls task-relevant parameters on the muscle level. We asked subjects to produce vertical fingertip force vectors of prescribed constant or time-varying magnitudes while maintaining a constant finger posture. We recorded intramuscular electromyograms (EMGs) simultaneously from all seven index finger muscles during this task. The experiment design and selective fine-wire muscle recordings allowed us to account for a median of 91\% of the variance of fingertip forces given the EMG signals. By analyzing muscle coordination in the seven-dimensional EMG signal space, we find that variance-per-dimension is consistently smaller in the task-relevant subspace than in the task-irrelevant subspace. This first direct physiological evidence on the muscle level for preferential control of task-relevant parameters strongly suggest the use of a neural control strategy compatible with the principle of minimal intervention. Additionally, variance is nonnegligible in all seven dimensions, which is at odds with the view that muscle activation patterns are composed from a small number of synergies.},

This process has traditionally been studied by examining how motor planning is adjusted in response to visuomotor or dynamic perturbations. Here, I show that the learning strategy can be better identified from the statistics of movements made in the absence of perturbations. The strategy identified this way differs from the learning mechanism assumed in mainstream models for motor learning. Crucial for this strategy is that motor noise arises partly centrally, in movement planning, and partly peripherally, in movement execution. Corrections are made by modification of central planning signals from the previous movement, which include the effects of planning but not execution noise. The size of the corrections is such that the movement variability is minimized. This physiologically plausible strategy is optimally tuned to the properties of motor noise, and likely underlies learning in many motor tasks.},

Here, we studied how the random effects of planning noise translate into changes in motor planning. Are the random effects independently added to a constant mean end point, or do they accumulate over movements? To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined repeated, discrete movements in various tasks in which the motor output could be decomposed into a task-relevant and a task-irrelevant component. We found in all tasks that the task-irrelevant component had a positive lag 1 autocorrelation, suggesting that the random effects of planning noise accumulate over movements. In contrast, the task-relevant component always had a lag 1 autocorrelation close to zero, which can be explained by effective trial-by-trial correction of motor planning on the basis of observed motor errors. Accumulation of the effects of planning noise is consistent with current insights into the stochastic nature of synaptic plasticity. It leads to motor exploration, which may subserve motor learning and performance optimization.},

Here we consider new views on the evolution of hand structure and on peripheral and central constraints for independent control of the digits of the hand. The human hand is widely assumed to have evolved from hands like those of African apes, yet recent studies have shown that our hands and those of the earliest hominids are very similar and unlike those of living apes. Understanding the limits of hand function may come from investigation of our last common ancestor with the great apes, rather than the great apes themselves. In the periphery, movement across the full range of joint space can be limited by mechanical linkages among the extrinsic muscles. Further, peripheral limits occur when the hand adopts some positions in which the contraction of muscles fails to move the joints on which they usually act; there is muscle `disengagement' and functional paralysis for some actions. Surprisingly, the central nervous system drives the hand seamlessly through this landscape of mechanical limits. Central constraints on control of the individual digits include the spillover of neural drive to neighbouring muscles and their `compartments', and the inability to make maximal muscle forces when multiple digits contract strongly which produces a force deficit. The pattern of these latter constraints correlates with amounts of daily use of each digit and favours enslaved extension to lift fingers from an object but selective flexion of fingers to contact it.},

Although it is widely assumed that this type of efficient control is implemented by processing that occurs in the cerebral cortex and brain stem, recent work has shown that spinal circuits can generate efficient motor output that supports keeping the hand in a static location. Here, we show that a spinal pathway can also efficiently control the hand during reaching. In our first experiment we applied multi-joint mechanical perturbations to participant's elbow and wrist as they began reaching towards a target. We found that spinal stretch reflexes evoked in elbow muscles were not proportional to how much the elbow muscles were stretched but instead were efficiently scaled to the hand's distance from the target. In our second experiment we applied the same elbow and wrist perturbations but had participants change how they grasped the manipulandum, diametrically altering how the same wrist perturbation moved the hand relative to the reach target. We found that changing the arm's orientation diametrically altered how spinal reflexes in the elbow muscles were evoked, and in such a way that were again efficiently scaled to the hand's distance from the target. These findings demonstrate that spinal circuits can help efficiently control the hand during dynamic reaching actions, and show that efficient and flexible motor control is not exclusively dependent on processing that occurs within supraspinal regions of the nervous system.},
