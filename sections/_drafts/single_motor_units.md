## SMU Control

Previous attempts to record electrical signals during voluntary muscle contractions have required advancement in recording technologies. One well-known example is Étienne-Jules Marey who, at the turn of the century, pioneered filmographic and electrode techniques to progress modern scientific recording. Similarly, Joseph Erlanger and Herbert Gasser were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1944 for their recordings using a modified low-voltage oscilloscope. Nearly a century after these technological leaps, our advancements lie within the realm of massively parallel computational capabilities. These allow large neural network analyses to tease apart the intricacies of the same neural signals in which Marey, Erlanger, and Gasser found an interest.

The quest for single motor unit action potentials in particular is similarly storied. Researchers at Oxford in 1948 write with fascination at hearing single muscle spikes combine to form a ``complex rumbling sound'' which:

\begin{quotation}
\noindent \textit{is heard from large muscles during voluntary contraction [and] must be due to the asynchronous activation of many motor units: the overall contraction of the muscle is then relatively smooth.} \cite{Gordon1948}
\end{quotation}

In the 1960s and 70s, there was a surge of interest in this quantum of behavior. In their 1962 experiment, Harrison and Mortenson provide real-time auditory and visual feedback to several subjects attempting SMU activation in the \textit{tibialis anterior} muscle using EMG signals via surface and needle electrodes. They claim that auditory feedback is more helpful for learning compared to visual feedback and that some form of ``external'' feedback is essential. They report a great variability in response with respect to ability: ``a considerable degree of `mental concentration' is needed for independent contractions'' \cite{Harrison1962}. They write that ``As many as six individual motor units were recruited and identified in some experiments'' though this was an extreme level of competency among their subjects.


% ``After individual motor units within the field of a surface or needle electrode were recruited, the subject attempted to isolate and contract the units independently.``

Writing in 1963, Basmajian reports similar findings: ``they groped around in their conscious efforts to find [SMUs] and sometimes, it seemed, only succeeded by accident''. Of those subjects who could do ``tricks'': ``they were unable to explain how they could do it'' and ``aural feedback was more useful than visual'' \cite{Basmajian1963}. Basmajian suggests a mechanism of ``active suppression of neighboring horn cells'' for SMU activation, and calls for ``more exploration of techniques for teaching motor skills''. He writes:

\begin{quotation}
\noindent\textit{Although the skills learned in the experiments initially depend on artificial feedbacks, they are learned so quickly and are so exquisite in some persons that they are retained after the feedbacks are eliminated. We do not know the reason because the subjects cannot explain their success or failure, being quite oblivious or of any special feeling. They state that they ``think'' about the previous tests with the cues. This aspect of these studies deserves large-scale investigations for it appears to be of fundamental significance in learning.}
\end{quotation}

Basmajian conducted a larger follow-up study in 1965 with 54 subjects. 46 could isolate well at least a single unit, while 20 could master a single unit, 18 two, 6 three, and 1 subject four and six units \cite{Basmajian1965}. Subjects found it difficult to ``re-find'' (switch between units) and isolate units separately. Wagman, in 1965, wrote on the idea of subjects leveraging proprioception to identify SMUs:

\begin{quotation}
\noindent\itshape{It appears that without training, volitional activation from the descending pathways is variable. Otherwise,the response of SMUs would not be dependent on maintenance of certain positions of the limb or certain patterns of contractions. During minimal contractions, the action of the descending pathways is modified, and perhaps controlled, probably in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, by peripheral input— proprioception, muscle contraction, or cutaneous stimuli. Therefore appropriate sensory information must be present for volitional activation of SMUs. However, after training, precise conscious control of SMUs can be established with lessened influence of peripheral stimuli.\cite{Wagman1965}}
\end{quotation}

Wagman's experiments provide evidence that the activation of motor units depends on ``the resting length of the muscle, the position of the joint members in space, and the specific function that the muscle was called on to perform''. He goes on to claim that ``the neuromuscular system cannot be regarded as a simple hierarchy of motor units with thresholds of response graded according to the degree of contraction, as has often been suggested.'' \newline

Leibrecht and Lloyd published a series of papers beginning in 1971 using a single light corresponding to correct and incorrect responses of SMU activation to test whether real-time EMG feedback is necessary for learning SMU activation \cite{Lloyd1971}. An experimenter controlled the feedback light as he/she watched an EMG trace. In this situation, ``results demonstrated that electromyographic feedback was not necessary for acquisition of SMU control''. They note that ``most subjects indicated an unawareness of the procedure used to elicit the correct response. Several of them formed superstitious behavior patterns which they considered essential.'' While they suggest subjects use so-called ``weak proprioception'' to learn the task, they write that while ``it can be assumed that the resulting SMU contraction provided sensory feedback from muscle receptors, the information was not sufficient. In many trials, subjects were completely unaware that they had made any response at all.'' Their overall claim is that real-time feedback in particular is not necessary for learning SMU activation. \newline

In a follow-up paper, Leibrecht and Lloyd found that retention after learning was independent of the type of feedback (EMG or non-) \cite{Leibrecht1973}. Auditory feedback, however, shortened the initial training required sixfold by, they speculated, ``shortening the search process''. A step further towards the implication of proprioceptive involvement, they tested if sensory isolation might help subjects learn SMU control by allowing them to attend to weak proprioceptive cues \cite{Lloyd1976}. Sensory isolation during learning worked roughly as well as in the feedback case, with different qualitative experiences of the subjects trying to discover single units:

\begin{quotation}
\noindent\textit{The sensory/perceptual isolation condition significantly facilitated the ability to isolate and control an SMU. The micro-environment of the air-fluidized bed in a light and sound attenuating chamber apparently reduced the amount and/or variety of exteroceptive sensory input, permitting the subjects to attend to the discrete proprioceptive information provided by the fine muscle contraction.}
\end{quotation}

<!-- % *They make the point that sensory isolation might have clinical significance as an alternative to biofeedback based treatments (This was in the 70s, after all).*
% *Learned and Relearned faster with sensory isolation (fastest learned in 60, relearned in 30 trials -- error or success)}

% SIZE PRINCIPLE % -->

The existence of voluntary SMU activation itself raises the question whether motor recruitment follows Henneman's ``size principle'' in all cases. Debate over the size principle in light of SMU activation experiments is interestingly framed by Ilyes in 1977:

\begin{quotation}
\noindent\textit{Basmajian and coworkers have found a more flexible recruitment order while Henneman's research group has found a more rigid one in the volitional control of the motor units. It may [...] be possible that this difference results from the fact that a more intensive variation of the proprioceptive input influencing the recruitment order was allowed in Basmajian's experiments than in that of Henneman's \cite{Illyes1977}.}
\end{quotation}

Ilyes develops a theory based on the interplay between excitation and inhibition in spinal circuits subjects use to achieve SMU activation. He notes, like others, that ``proprioceptive input may have facilitative and inhibitive effect on the pool of the targeted muscle.'' His interpretation nicely summarizes the general findings in the SMU work to date:

\begin{quotation}
\noindent\textit{ ...exteroceptive feedback displays the results of the spinal interaction between the direct overt, isometric response and the indirect, covert, isotonic postural response. During the training, subjects try to find the most favorable matching of these two coinnervation processes with continuous control by the exteroceptive feedback to attain the successful single motor unit isolation. The simultaneous central and proprioceptive activation of the motor neuron pool of the controlled muscle may give an answer to the difference between the results of Basmajian and Henneman.}
\end{quotation}

% ``Our tentatively formulated paradigm and interpretations need verification by further experiments.''

\section{\bfseries\scshape{Discussion \& Design}}

The literature shows that learning SMU activation is nontrivial. While some mixture of internal and external feedback seems \textit{sufficient} to learn the task at least to a partial degree in most cases, it is not clear to what extent such feedbacks are \textit{necessary} for robust learning. It seems that only in the most skilled subjects, under particular conditions, a handful of units can be activated independently. To achieve at least this level of activation with any subject, we focus on two subgoals. The first deals with isolating single units and determining the environmental factors contributing to their activation. The second subgoal aims to develop paradigms that utilize a particular combination of these factors towards building a model of learning to elicit SMU spikes. This model can then be used to develop protocols which combine independent units to construct arbitrary spike patterns.
