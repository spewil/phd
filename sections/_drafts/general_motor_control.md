## general problem of motor control

Latash book

**motor control** : an area of science exploring natural laws that define how the nervous system interacts with other body parts and the environment to produce purposeful, coordinated movements.

Certain features of the neuro-sensory-motor system look, to put it mildly, suboptimal, particularly when considered by an expert in designing artificial moving systems.

As of now, the main problems of motor control are not in finding answers but in formulating questions.
