The corticospinal outputs that can drive a particular arm muscle, even an intrinsic hand muscle, are located within overlapping regions of the motor cortex.

Motor cortical cells (many of which have corticospinal projections) discharge with movement of more than one dig it and those associated with a particular movement are not tightly clustered. The corticospinal projection provides a further complication because the axons branch to supply more than one motor nucleus (Shinoda et al. 1981). These overlapping areas in the motor cortex may be optimal for daily usage of the hand, but also constrain the ability to control the digits independently.
