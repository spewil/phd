## Hardware

There are two streams in the setup's hardware:
1. Electrode to Computer
2. Everything else

The first stream handles the motion of electrodes perturbed by the electric field created due to synapses at the muscle and captured by the sensor circuit. The second stream handles the mechanical constraints around the subject's arm and hand during data acquisition. This second stream fixes the arm and hand in place in order to limit data to isometric contractions.
