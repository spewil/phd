## Anatomy of the Hand and Forearm

Muscles are collections of fibers that contract when chemical gradients are produced at the neuromuscular junction by action potentials emanating from neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord.

Electromyography is the detection of changes in chemical potential using electrodes. In my setup, we use a total 64 monopolar surface electrodes and monopolar needle electrodes to record chemical potentials from muscles in the forearm and hand.

### Motor Units

> The motor unit, namely a motoneurone and the many muscle fibres singularly innervated by branches of the motoneurone’s axon, is the quantal element underlying the transduction of neural commands driving the exquisite motor behaviours produced by the hand. (Fuglevand 2011)

Experimental work characterizing motor unit properties in humans and other mammals has been consistent with regard to two findings(see Fuglevandet al.1993). First, twitch or tetanic forces of motor units that constitute a muscle vary over an extremely wide range, usually 100-fold or greater. And second, the frequency distribution of motor units according to force capacity is markedly skewed toward motor units that produce small forces, with few units that generate large forces. (Fuglevand 2011)

One consequence of this organization is that fine resolution of force is an in-built control feature, such that when performing delicate motor tasks involving weak muscle contractions, subtle adjustments in force can be accomplished by drawing upon a large population of weak motor units. (*this is logarthmic in the number of units recruited*) (Fuglevand 2011)

**Motor unit number itself seems to play a critical role in determining precision of muscle force. When human subjects attempt to produce a constant force during isometric contractions, the force inadvertently fluctuates about the specified target level. Such force variability increases in roughly in proportion to the target force(Enoka et  al.2003). Unexpectedly, this noise in force control is greater for hand muscles compared to more proximal muscles (Hamilton et al.2004). Furthermore,based on available estimates of motor unit numbers and computer simulation, a key factor underlying greater noisiness in hand muscles was relatively low numbers of motor units (Jones et al.2002; Hamilton et al.2004). In addition, augmented force variability in hand muscles maybe related to greater variability and common modulation in motor unit discharge rate compared to more proximal muscles (Negro et al.2009). Therefore, the widely held view that hand muscles are optimally designed for fine control may require reconsideration.** (Fuglevand 2011)

While there are anatomical (Feinsteinet  al.1955) and electrophysiological (McComaset  al.1971; Bromberg,2007) means to estimate motor unit numbers in humans,both methods are susceptible to several sources of error.Perhaps the most reliable information at present available about relative numbers of motor units supplying different muscles comes from retrograde labelling of motoneurones in non-human primates. In such studies, intrinsic hand muscles have been shown to be innervated by approximately 50–200 motoneurones, while more proximal muscles like biceps and triceps brachii are each supplied by more than 1000 motoneurones (Jenny & Inukai, 1983). (Fuglevand 2011)

### Kinematics

The human hand has approximately 20 degrees of freedom in its 19 joints, but the number of dominant modes of activity is much lower due to mechanical coupling.

27 bones and 36 muscles (???)

There are 31 muscles of different and often complex architecture involved in hand movement with 19 residing in the hand (the intrinsic hand muscles). The hand has 19 articulations, 18 tendons crossing the wrist, and at least 25 degrees of freedom. (Duinen & Gandevia 2011)

### Thumb

The human thumb confers great scope for dexterity and its long length relative to the index gives it the highest ‘opposability index’ among primates (Napier, 1972), while its rotated first metacarpal and unique carpometacarpal joint enhance its range of movement for grasping and manipulation (Wood-Jones, 1949). Furthermore, the thumb is moved by a muscle in the forearm, ﬂexor pollicis longus (FPL), which provides the only way to ﬂex its distal joint and is rudimentary in apes. (Hiske van Duinen and Simon C. Gandevia 2011)

The presence of FPL in humans is associated with a high capacity to s ense thumb voluntary forces at remarkably low levels compared even to intrinsic hand muscles (muscles with their origin and insertion in the hand; Kilbreath & Gandevia, 1993) and to detect length changes at its distal joint (Refshauge et al. 1998). (Hiske van Duinen and Simon C. Gandevia 2011)

### Hand

The intrinsic hand muscles can also be activated almost maximally (e.g. Merton, 1954; Herbert & Gandevia, 1996), but they are special in that they can b e ‘controlled’ at very low levels, even below the recruitment threshold for the earliest recruited units (Gandevia & Rothwell, 1987). (Duinen & Gandevia 2011)

### Forearm

The main finger extensor, extensor digitorum (ED), when active generates torque about the elbow, wrist, metacarpalphalanegeal, proximal interphalangeal and distal interphalangeal joints simultaneously (Anet  al.1981). Moreover, ED, likeits flexor counterparts, flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor digitorum profundus, gives rise to four distal tendons that insert into each of the fingers.Therefore, attempts to move a single finger in isolation require that other muscles be co-activated to counteract the unwanted  actions produced by the agonist (Schieber, 1995; Valero-Cuevas, 2000). (Fuglevand 2011)

Three major forearm muscles consist of multiple muscle bellies with tendons to each finger so that the muscles have four ‘compartments’ (Duinen & Gandevia 2011)

Force and displacement interactions can occur within muscles, an issue of particular concern given that ﬂexor digitorum profundus (FDP), ﬂexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and extensor digitorum (ED) are muscles with tendons to each of the fingers. These interactions may occur, for example, because a motor unit’s territory is such that force is ‘injected’ into more than one distal tendon. This sort of ‘lateral’ force transmission exerted by individual muscle fibres and motor units can be significant in some animal preparations (e.g. Street, 1983; see also Young et al. 2000). The topic of lateral force transmission is controversial but it appears that such an effect can even result in inter-muscle force transfer (e.g. for review Patel & Lieber, 1997; Huijing, 1999, 2009). This process has been most studied in the lower limb for gastrocnemius and soleus in animals (for details see Maas & Sandercock, 2008) but some evidence exists for it in humans (e.g. Bojsen-Moller et al. 2010). However, the unresolved issues are the magnitude of these effects and the conditions under which they are functionally significant. (Duinen & Gandevia 2011)

If hand muscles do not always behave as simple in-line motors, then the spread of their mechanical effects must depend on the links of force–length curve, viscoelastic properties, and the changes induced by muscle contractions. Such detailed biomechanical information is largely lacking. (Duinen & Gandevia 2011)

Spillover has been shown in experiments studying the ‘recruitment thresholds’ (defined below) of motor units ac ting on other digits during single digit contractions (Kilbreath & Gandevia, 1994; Butler et al. 2005; van Duinen et al. 2009). In these experiments, motor units were recorded from one (test) compartment of the respective muscles, while subjects were asked to contract the compartment of the other digits up to 50% of their maximal force. When the subjects contracted these other digits (one by one), motor units of the test compartment were often recruited. The amount of force produced by the other digits at the time of recruitment of the motor unit of the test compartment is termed the recruitment threshold. The general finding for all three muscles was that, the closer the contracting compartment to the test finger, the more motor units were recruited. (Duinen & Gandevia 2011)

One has to ask whether this spillover is functional. Is the frequent recruitment of motor units ac ting on the little finger when we extend the thumb part of a fixed pattern of muscle activation, perhaps to balance forces around the wrist? (Duinen & Gandevia 2011)

Until recently, most studies looked at either flexion or extension, but when we compare the amount of enslavement in flexion and extension, the enslaved forces in extension are higher than in flexion, when recorded in the same apparatus. We hypothesise that the level of enslavement might depend on the amount of individual daily usage (for data on usage see Ingram et al. 2008). (Duinen & Gandevia 2011)

When multiple digits had to contract, the subjects were not able to reach their maximal force, thus showing a force ‘deﬁcit’. These deﬁcits may be comparable to those when trying to produce force with two hands or arms, a phenomenon known as the bilateral deﬁcit (Gandevia, 2001).


### Muscle Spindles

Arm  movements  are  sensed  via  distributed  and  individually  ambiguous  activity  patterns  of  muscle  spindles,which depend on relative joint configurations rather than the absolute hand position.  Interpreting this high dimensional  input  (around  50  muscles  for  a  human  arm)  of  distributed information at the relevant behavioral level poses a challenging  decoding  problem  for  the  central  nervous  system. Proprioceptive information from the receptors undergoes several  processing  steps  before  reaching  somatosensory  cortex (3,8) - from the spindles that synapse in Clarke’s nucleus, to cuneate nucleus, thalamus (3,9), and finally to somatosensory cortex (S1).   In cortex,  a number of tuning properties have been observed, such as responsiveness to varied combinations of joints and muscle lengths (10,11), sensitivity to different loads and angles (12), and broad and unimodal tuning for movement direction during arm movements (11,13).The proprioceptive information in S1 is then hypothesized to serve as the basis of a wide variety of tasks, via its connections to motor cortex and higher somatosensory processing regions.
