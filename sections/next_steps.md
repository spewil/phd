# Next Steps 

## GPI for OFC (1 day)

Write up written notes on this

2. Is GPI with LQRs / LQR-RL a good model for motor learning? Define a model and see if it recapitulates known motor learning phenomena on existing experiments + accounts for things that previous models donâ€™t. (Similar in spirit to Geerts et al. (2020)). Can this model track the higher-order statistics of trajectories during motor learning?

## Transfer Tasks in Virtual Environment

### Preliminary Data 

Analyze prelim data from Andy

Our preliminary data confirms the working principle of the setup and highlights the next steps for producing a quality dataset. 

We must
- address the noise concerns in the data
- formalize specific task designs which link with our theoretical interests
