## Goals

- measure across learning
- analyze this learning sequence to find traces of what's being learned at a trajectory level
- gain inspiration for what might be modeled

## Recording Setup

<!-- I would be most interested to hear how u are thinking of approaching the analysis. I.e. u have a bunch of channels, movements, tasks what is the workflow to get from that raw data into something manageable/useful. -->


<!-- The long term goal of the research direction suggested here is to develop tasks which ask subjects to produce a variety of movements in response to a variety of goals and perturbations. This will allow us to study the computations that humans use in everyday tasks to solve the motor problems they face. This stands in contrast to many repetitions of the same movements. However, we wish to validate our experimental setup on classical tasks as a stepping stone to tasks with greater variety. -->

<!-- "we know how to design and interpret experiments that involve many repetitions of the same movement however there is limited role for online optimization in that context. instead we need experiments where subjects are required to come up with new movements all the time. how can we get experimenters to do such experiments? show cool movies of robots doing cool things,and hopefully get the experimenters excited." (todorov online optimization slides) -->

The concept of the experimental setup is shown in {+@fig:setup}, where 32 monopolar electrodes are attached to a subjectâ€™s forearm to record muscle activity. The arm and hand are kinematically constrained in a custom fixture and motor activity is recorded during low-level isometric muscle contractions. The setup circumvents the limb biomechanics by mapping muscle output directly to virtual stimuli shown on a screen. By focusing on low-force, isometric contractions we intend to avoid complications due to artifacts in dynamic, high-force movements.

As far as we are aware, this setup is novel in combining a high number of channels with an abstract mapping. Learning experiments have used joint angles and a few muscles (typically movements of the wrist or pairs of thumb and intrinsic hand muscles), but none have taken a data-driven approach in constructing a virtual learning environment in the style of cortical BMI[@BergerDifferencesInAdaptationRates2013a;@Dyson2018;@radhakrishnanLearningNovelMyoelectricControlled2008;@Gallego2017]. Our EMG recording setup is custom-built: the "Sessantaquattro" EMG amplifier was acquired from OT Bioelettronica, the electronic connector was designed in-house, the electrodes were acquired from Medkit UK, and the recording software was written in a mixture of Bonsai (C#) and Python. EMG is acquired at 2kHz sample rate with 24-bit precision. A clip of raw data is shown in {+@fig:raw_data}.

![10 seconds of raw 32-channel EMG data taken during a minimal finger flexion trial. Note that some channels include a nontrivial amount of line noise. This noise will be drastically reduced through changes being made in the next recording hardware revision which include shielding, shorter cables, and better cable routing. Note that some channels (e.g. channel 24) show very low noise and putative single motor unit action potentials can be seen on many channels.](images/data_analysis/fingers/raw_data.pdf){width=100% #fig:raw_data}

To preprocessing the data, simple filtering and rectifying were applied, as is commonly done in the literature[@sangerBayesianFilteringMyoelectric2007;@churchlandNeuralPopulationDynamics2012a;@churchlandNeuralVariabilityPremotor2006;@sussillo2015]. As shown in {+@fig:preprocessing_steps}, here we apply highpass filtering at 40Hz to remove any low-frequency oscillations and DC offsets, rectification and lowpass filtering at 5Hz to extract what is typically associated with a force readout of the EMG signal in the case that electrodes are positioned over the belly of a single muscle. These filter parameters were chosen by visual comparison across a range of values. While these preprocessing steps are in accordance with the literature and yield a signal with frequencies on a behavioral timescale though, as discussed in {+@sec:next_steps}, preprocessing of raw EMG signals is an area worth investigating the development and application of more advanced methods.

![Data from a single trial showing each step of preprocessing. The prototype preprocessing pipeline is highpass at 50Hz, rectification, and lowpass at 5Hz. The within-trial, per-channel means are subtracted from each trial. This matches what is typically done in the literature to find a correlate of intended force[@sangerBayesianFilteringMyoelectric2007;@churchlandNeuralPopulationDynamics2012a;@churchlandNeuralVariabilityPremotor2006;@sussillo2015]. There is significant room for improvement on this workflow, as discussed in the text.](images/data_analysis/fingers/preprocessing_steps.pdf){width=100% #fig:preprocessing_steps}




## Open-loop Finger Recordings

In our first preliminary experiment, a single subject produced flexions and extensions of each finger in the recording setup without any kind of artificial feedback. One trial was collected per finger movement in three blocks per session and one session per day over five days for a total of fifteen trials per finger movement. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the robustness over trials and sessions of EMG features for a simple low-contraction movement, as well as to determine the level of noise and artifacts in the data. Such baseline measurements are important to properly decompose variability due to electrode placement and exogenous noise from behavioral and physiological variability in order to ensure reproducibility of our results. Additionally, this baseline task may prove useful as a benchmark for later tasks in terms of testing analysis and decomposition techniques. A plot of all 32 channels for a single trial after preprocessing is shown in {+@fig:preprocessed_data}.

![All channels of data from a single trial after preprocessing. Note the difference in baseline for each channel. Ideally, each channel has a clear baseline of no activity, as further discussed in the main text.](images/data_analysis/fingers/preprocessed_data.pdf){width=100% #fig:preprocessed_data}

We first asked whether PCA applied to each individual trial would extract a single, high-variance component reflecting the dimensionality of the behavior. Since each finger movement is intuitively one dimensional, we predict that PCA would find a single high-variance component when run on each individual trial. As shown in {+@fig:PCA_variances}, this is generally the case, though there are some outlier trials. After inspecting these outlier trials, it is likely that the subject moved multiple fingers in these trials counter to the experimenter's instruction.

![Fraction of variance captured by the top 5 principle components for trials of single finger extensions and flexions. PCs were computed for individual trials. Trials were recorded from one subject for 10s each trial with finger movement frequency approximately 1Hz. Three blocks each with one trial per finger movement were recorded per day for 5 days for a total of 15 trials per finger. Electrodes were not removed between blocks but were removed between days. Each trial displays a single high-variance PC component.](images/data_analysis/fingers/PCA_variances.pdf){width=100% #fig:PCA_variances}

We next asked, since each trial appeared to be dominated by a single principle component, whether this top component was stable across trials and across days. If the top component is stable, it implies that the recording apparatus is robust to electrode movement between sessions. The top components for each movement after running PCA on each trial are shown in {+@fig:PCA_components}. While it is not typical to run PCA on individual trials, for the purpose of visually inspecting the PCA weights over EMG channels it is used here.

![The top principle component from each single finger movement trials plotted as weights across channels. PCA was computed for each trial individually. White horizontal lines show breaks between days when electrodes were removed and reapplied. Each trial's top component is relatively stable across trials and across days, though there is drift and dropout of weights. Measures to increase cross-session stability are discussed in the main text. Movements appear to vary between strong localization on single channels and broad activation across channels.](images/data_analysis/fingers/PCA_components.pdf){width=100% #fig:PCA_components}


The results here suggest that, at least up to linear decompositions, the features of low-contraction movements is relatively robust across sessions. As discussed in {+@sec:next_steps}, we will construct more reliable means to place electrodes on subjects' forearms to further increase repeatability. Another aspect of these results is our assumption subjects are producing the same contraction each time they move their finger, and at the same contraction level. That is, we assume they are recruiting the same motor units each movement. This may not be the case, and constructing new analyses which infer motor unit activations may be useful to mitigate this issue.

<!-- Electrode data from a single trial of a single session is held in a data matrix $X$ (n_electrodes, n_samples), and we wish to find a latent weight matrix $W$ (n_electrodes, n_components) which reconstructs $X$ by projecting latent trajectories $H$ (n_components, n_samples) into electrode space:

$$
X = W\cdot{H}
$$

$H$ is the activity of the latent processes, and $W$ is there mixing matrix. The columns of $W$ are the principal vectors spanning the latent subspace in electrode space. If we have new samples, we can project these new points onto this subspace:

$$
h_{new} = W^T\cdot{w_{new}}
$$

To justify this decomposition, we have to make some assumptions about the nature of the EMG signal, namely that the signal is linear instantaneous (each EMG sample can be instantly mapped to control space). The other assumption is that the basis $W$ should be orthonormal, that the columns of $W$ are orthogonal with unity norm. This ensures that the left inverse $W^{-1}$ is equal to the transpose $W^T$ such that:

\begin{align*}
X &= W\cdot{H} \\
W^{-1}\cdot{X} &= {H} \\
W^{T}\cdot{X} &= {H}
\end{align*}

See *Muceli 2014* for use of the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse in place of the transpose when the columns of $W$ do not form an orthonormal basis. This would be the case for NMF. Is there a factorization that produces nonnegative, orthogonal coordinates? Or is the pseudoinverse okay? I will need to test this.

Stated in an information theoretic way, we want to minimize the reconstruction loss $\mathcal{L}$ for our derived encoder-decoder pair ($E$,$D$). We're decoding high dimensional activity into its latent dimensions, and encoding back into the high dimensional space. :

$$
\min_{E,D}{\mathcal{L}\left[X - EDX\right]}
$$

This way, forget about orthonormality and solve for an encoder and decoder directly. That is, $E\neq{D}$ is perfectly acceptable.

Each row of $D$ might be called a **spatial filter**, a linear combination of electrode activities into a surrogate, hopefully more intuitive space.

In general to find such a basis we must :

## Center-hold Reach-out Task

In this task, the 32-dimensional EMG electrode activity vector is mapped to a 2D force acting on a point mass shown on the screen. The mapping $M\in\mathbb{R}^{2x32}$ maps 8 "columns" each consisting of 4 electrodes placed in a line down the length of the forearm each to one of 2D root of unity. Each column of electrodes is thus mapped to one of 8 two-dimensional force vectors. In this experiment, the point mass has zero inertia and zero friction and as such displays a direct, though redundant, readout of the EMG signal. The task asks the subject to reach one of 32 equally spaced targets on each trial. Subjects must hold in the center of the task space for a designated period of time, after which the target appears. Subjects then have a time window reach the target. Data from one subject was recorded for three blocks in one session. Each block consisted of 32 trials, one per target in a randomized order.

The mapping between EMG and task space $M$ can be written as

$$
M = \begin{bmatrix}\tilde{M} & \tilde{M} & \tilde{M} & \tilde{M}\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $\tilde{M}$ consists of 8 equally spaced directions, one for each "column" of the 4 EMG electrode bands around the subject's arm:

$$
\tilde{M} =
\begin{bmatrix}
0  & 0.71  & 1   & 0.71   & 0  & -0.71  & -1  & -0.71 \\
1  & 0.71  & 0  & -0.71  & 1   & -0.71   & 0   & 0.71
\end{bmatrix}
$$

A graphic showing the mappings from electrodes to force directions is shown in {+@fig:columns}. While there are 8 possible force vectors the subject can modulate by controlling the electrode activity on each of her 8 columns, the EMG mapping is ultimately a projection onto the 2D plane. Since the EMG signal is nonnegative, the subject could technically modulate just four modes of electrode activity, the minimum number needed to span the task space, to reach all 32 targets. This mapping was chosen in order to provide a simple starting point to explore the virtual EMG task. There are no added environmental dynamics, only a redundant readout of force, and the signal is processed online in the same manner as in the offline analyses. This task or a variant we think can serve as a foundation upon which we can build more complex mappings and virtual environments. Task space trajectories from each block are shown in {+@fig:trajectories}. The fraction of trials resulting in hold timeouts, reach timeouts, and target hits are shown over blocks in {+@fig:hit_fraction}.

![Graphic showing the mapping between electrodes in the 32-channel center-hold reach-out experiment to eight 2D force directions in the virtual task space.

![Fractions of trial outcome types for each block of the center-hold, reach-out task. Hit fraction increases on each trial, suggesting the beginnings of task learning.

Part of learning to activate certain muscle modes is learning to inhibit others.](images/data_analysis/center_hold/hit_fraction.pdf){width=70% #fig:hit_fraction}

In this task, the subject's first goal is to interact through the mapping $M$ and learn the consequences of various motor activations. That is, they must internalize a model of the virtual environment, what might be called a system identification problem. Subjects must collect data containing motor outputs and their sensory consequences. To do this, they must explore the space of activity. We predict that over trials, subjects' EMG activities over channels will become more varied as they attempt new movement patterns to achieve their twin goals of learning to move in this new environment and reaching the target. Running PCA on each individual trial's EMG time series, we hypothesize that initially we will see multiple components share signal variance as subjects explore. Eventually, we would expect to see a decrease in this measure of movement complexity a subjects hone their reaching skill. Trial-level PCA component variance fractions are shown in {+@fig:PCA_trial_variance}. We find an initial decrease in the top component's variance fraction, though we expect many more trials will be needed to see skill acquisition in the form of a dominant movement mode per trial.

![Fraction of variance captured by the top five principle components when PCA is run on the EMG time series' of individual trials of the center-hold, reach-out task. Error bars are standard deviation. Over blocks, we see a slight decrease in the mean of the top component's variance fraction, though with high variance. This may suggest greater exploration within-trial, as less variance is captured by a single component over blocks, though it could reflect more varied dynamics across trials as the subject discovers new, task-relevant activations.](images/data_analysis/center_hold/PCA_trial_variance.pdf){width=70% #fig:PCA_trial_variance}

We might model this task as the subject selecting an EMG signal $x$ which minimizes the distance between a target position $b$ and the projection of the EMG signal through the mapping $M$ as well as minimizes the norm of $x$ in order to conserve metabolic energy. This optimization can be written as a regularized least squares problem:  

$$
\min_x\frac{1}{2}||Mx - b||^2_2 + \frac{\lambda}{2}||x||_2^2.
$$

This problem is known to have a unique minimum for $\lambda>0$ which is an approximation $Mx\approx b$ regardless of the shape or rank of $M$. This implies that the subject, if they are biophysically capable to do so, will learn distinct motor outputs for each target rather than reusing modes for multiple targets with different activation levels. That is the subject will, over time, learn to fractionate their muscle output to reach their goal in order to minimize effort. For instance, to reach the the target at position $(1,0)$ in Cartesian coordinates, the subject could activate a bespoke activity mode and activate a combination of two or more modes for targets at $\pm45^\circ$ from this central target. If this is the case, the model predicts that the dimensionality of the EMG signal will increase over the course of training as the subject learns to construct bespoke activity modes for each target.

In {+@fig:PCA_concat_variance} we compute PCA on the concatenation of all trials within blocks for which we predict an increase in the number of dominant EMG modes as subjects learn multiple movements to reach individual targets. We expect subjects to, over time, develop some number of bespoke movement modes to activate independently and as a composition to reach each target. We find a suggestion of this idea in the data with our basic PCA analysis. More trials, session, and subjects will be required to explore this idea, and we are investigating probabilistic measures of signal complexity such as entropy to formalize this hypothesis. One direction might be to further define this task a regularized regression with different regularization terms chosen normatively for different sections of the learning and control process, and fitting data to these predictions. For instance, early in training subjects may not optimize for target accuracy as much as for signal sparsity, whereas later in learning subjects may optimize for target accuracy and output signal magnitude.

![Fraction of variance captured by PCA computed on concatenated EMG time series concatenated over trials. Over blocks, we see variance shifting from the top component to other components. We hypothesize that across learning we would see the development of bespoke modes used in combination to reach individual targets. This would predict an increase in the complexity of the EMG time series over learning. Here we see suggestions of this prediction.](images/data_analysis/center_hold/PCA_concat_variance.pdf){width=70% #fig:PCA_concat_variance}

<!-- 1. System Identification -- learning a transition function $p(y_t|x_t, u_t)$
    - How do you learn the unknown observation model from data?

1. Policy Optimization
    - Once dynamics are learned (or at least stable?), how do we form a policy that is generalizable to new tasks under these dynamics?
    - This is the control problem.

It's safe to assume that these processes are happening in parallel. Because we have complete and arbitrary control over the observation mapping, we can ask the subject to interact through a  dynamic that is intuitive (informative prior) or unintuitive (uninformative or inhibitive prior). Each scenario, we hypothesize, will elicit different strategies for learning and control.
