The distinction between knowledge-how and knowledge-that was brought to scrutiny in analytic philosophy by Ryle in his seminal The Concept of Mind (1949), where he raised some of the now classical objections to the so-called “intellectualist legend”: the view that knowledge-how amounts to knowledge-that. Ryle instead advocated an “anti-intellectualist” view of knowledge-how according to which knowledge-how and knowledge-that are distinct kinds of knowledge, and manifestations of knowledge-how are not necessarily manifestations of knowledge-that. This anti-intellectualism has been the received view among philosophers for a long time.

HM was unable to form new memories of facts or events and he could no longer access memories he acquired in the few years leading up to his surgery. Nevertheless, it was found that over 10 trials, HM tuned his motor skill to trace the outline of a five-pointed star based only on looking at reflection in a mirror. Since he could not store new memories, HM’s declarative knowledge of the means of performing the task did not change from one trial to the next. But his performance improved. So, the reasoning goes, the improvement of motor skills is governed by a distinct cognitive system from that which governs the retention of declarative facts.

In contemporary times, the notion of skill is central to the philosophy of the twentieth-century French phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Merleau-Ponty (1945 [1962]) distinguishes between motor intentionality—the sort of intentionality relevant for motor skills—and cognitive intentionality. While the latter is conceptual and representational, Merleau-Ponty thought that motor intentionality is non-representational and non-conceptual. Central to Merleau-Ponty is the role of motor skills in shaping perceptual experience: in paradigmatic cases of perception, the flow of information taken in by perceivers is inseparable from the way they move through a scene. On this view, even superficially static perceptions engage motor skills, such as seeing the color of a table as uniform when different parts of it are differently illuminated (see Siegel 2020 for an helpful introduction).

Christensen, Sutton and McIlwain (2016) and Christensen, Sutton, and Bicknell’s (2019) argue for the centrality of cognition in explaining the flexibility of skilled action in complex situations and advance a “mesh theory” of skilled action, according to which skilled action results for a mesh of both automatic and cognitively controlled processes (for a survey of some of these issues, Christensen 2019).

The topic of skill and expertise is central since ancient philosophy through the notion of technē. Although both Plato and Aristotle took technē to be a kind of knowledge, there is significant controversy about their conceptions regarding the nature of this kind of knowledge and its relation to experience (empeiria) on one hand, and scientific knowledge (epistēmē) on the other

interaction between learning systems -- cortex, cerebellum, basal ganglia -- strategy / unsupervised prediction / supervised, RL / policies?
this leads to multiple learning rates, fast and slow learning, discontinuities in learning

questions -- what information influences learning?
that is, what projection of the data best explains performance increases?
is this projection / this information the same across participants?

skill learning will lead to hierarchy, and different levels of the hierarchy may be learned at different times by different means/systems

what is the mostly likely deconvolution of the learning curve?

what do our learning curves look like? plateaus? discontinuities?
can we measure performance within trial? (movement towards target at each time step?)

what you're learning is dimensions of goal-relevance... as these dimensions are learned, we see changes in variability and in performance

"To view skilled performance as being the product of underlying component
processes is to see a learning curve as a macrocosm of many individual
learning experiences. Performance at one point in time reflects what has been
learned at some previous time that is able to impact on performance at the
moment. Thus, although a learning curve may be viewed as reflecting an
incremental improvement process that leads to a smooth transition from
novice to expert performance, it is actually a summary of the operation of a
vast number of component processes, each with their own improvement
functions, and each with varying histories of application with or without
success."

-- Speelman, Kirsner *Beyond the Learning Curve*

"Because some
tasks require that certain components be mastered before other components
can be performed or even attempted, there is likely to be a typical develop-
mental sequence in acquiring certain skills. Furthermore, if substantial work is
required for component processes to reach a level of mastery before higher
level tasks can be attempted, then there is likely to be some period of consolida-
tion in the acquisition of the higher level skill. That is, there will be periods in
which there appears to be little progress being made in performance of the
task. Closer scrutiny, however, may reveal that performance is improving, but
only on lower level components of the task. According to this view of skill
acquisition, then, the processes that underlie plateaus in learning curves may
also underlie the stages that are characteristic of cognitive development
(Piaget, 1953)."

-- Speelman, Kirsner *Beyond the Learning Curve*

"Learning is not like a coin, which remains physically whole even through the most
infamous transactions; it is, rather, like a very handsome dress, which is worn out
through use and ostentation."
-- Umberto Eco (‘The Name of the Rose’)
