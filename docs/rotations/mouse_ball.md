# Mouse Ball

I used a Logitech trackball mouse to set up a mouse motor task. I realized in the end that I would be better served in my efforts to use human data to test my hypotheses, but I think experiments like the one I intended to set up are very important in understanding dexterous motor control. It would take some time for mice to learn this task, but I think it would be well worth it. Home cage training would almost be essential.

The image sensor in an old-school logitech mouse. [Here's](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/420067/help-identifying-a-cmos-optical-mouse-sensor) some awesome history about the development of these VLSI sensors.

Here's a gif of the type of dexterous behavior I was looking for mice to elicit:
