## Questions

### high-level

- what are the algorithms for learning novel motor skills?
- what are the algorithms for solving motor challenges?
	- are these algorithms adaptive? de novo?
- what is a normative theory for motor learning in novel skill acquisition?
- what is de novo learning? is it acquiring an entirely new "neural controller" or "internal model"?
	- why do we care about this? isn't everything adaptation?
- how does the brain use actions to learn efficiently?
- how does the CNS use action to learn optimally?
- how would we know why a task is difficult?
	- is it due to the physical interactions or the information processing?
- are we optimal? how do synergies play a role in optimality?
- are there synergies?
	- are they "hard-wired"?
	- are they flexible?
	- are they learned?
	- physiological support
	- experimental support
- can we track (dynamical) model acquisition over trials, testing our ability to use that model along the way?
- Perhaps the model acquisition stage is a process of active sensing-- what strategies do we employ to search the mapping space? How do we know when we're confident of our understanding of the mapping?
- How do you (what (sampling) strategies do you use to) actively acquire new (or adapt existing) internal (forward/inferential/cognitive) models in high-dimensional, nonlinear, and/or continuous state spaces to produce goal-directed motor outputs?
- What (suboptimal) approximations/heuristics do we leverage during this process?
- How are these related to innate/learned priors?
- The statistics of the task space drive the representation of movement, but how do we utilize (or sample?) the statistics of the environment to efficiently produce movements that achieve task goals?
- Can we explore the priors we use to efficiently learn new sensorimotor mappings by engineering the statistics of a task? (@ virtual surgery work)

### meta

- What's the difference between riding a bicycle and playing a video game?
- how does an MCI task probe the relationship between these schemes?
	- the argument is that because we can track learning in a completely novel task, we can work on connecting learning and control in one study.
	- this ideally can all be thought about in one mathematical framework-- probabilistic graphical models
- what do we (think we) know about motor learning?
	what is motor adaptation?
	where does cosine tuning come from?
- what are the weaknesses of behavioral models?
- what are we going up against? what is conventional wisdom?
- what's our beef? what's our impact?
- if we're floundering in a task, how do we find our way?

## task specific

- what behavior is available in daily life?
- what behavior is available in a given task?
- how long is a "trial"?
	- enough to allow feedback control
	- short enough to analyze the data
- how do we generate mappings?
	- see yu, golub, etc for monkey BCI mappings

## modeling

- what is the state-of-the-art model for learning a new skill?
	- for solving a new mapping+planning problem?
	- OFC is for control of a learned mapping?
	- two-rate error-driven learning is for adaption?
- how does path programming fit in here?
- how can a new paradigm help us tease these question apart? how can it hurt us?
- Can we connect this long-term learning to a computational theory of feedback control over the muscles in the face of an ongoing goal? That is, can we carefully characterize the way the nervous system adapts at the motor pool level to formally connect computational theories of learning (OFC, RL, ???) with low-level physiology?
- Can a theoretical characterization at the motor pool level give us some insight into how physiological changes (structural changes) influence the way in which we approach solving and adapting to behaviorally relevant tasks? Behaviorally relevant stimuli?
- how do you formalize forward models, inverse models, and feedback control probabilistically?
