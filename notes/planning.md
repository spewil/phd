# Planning

### Sprint 1 (Next week)

#### Set up, organize, orient, set goals




### Goals

* [ ] finish bulk of thesis analysis + writing, pass tiago's viva bar
* [ ] project manage this well, to transition into my next job
* [ ] generate data and code for others to explore and use, add this to portfolio
* [ ] write a minimal paper about the experiment, presenting the new paradigm to the community and generating exploratory results towards suggestions for followup (confirmatory) studies


### Admin

* [ ] pick a rough exam date
* [ ] pick examiners and andy reach out to them
* [ ] examiner nomination forms (4mo before)
* [ ] send thesis to examiners 6wks before
* [ ] format thesis https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/research-assessments/format-bind-and-submit-your-thesis-general-guidance
* [ ] enter exam in Portico https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/research-assessments/examination-entry https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/research-assessments/viva


# Week 1 - Jul 31 - Aug 6
* [x] email Klara, touch base about plans
* [x] recruit Brett for research eng, analysis (max \~6hrs a week)
* [x] upload data to s3 for collaboration
* [x] make draft goals and timeline for Tiago to review
* [x] email Tiago, share planning and current state
* [x] schedule Tiago meeting
* [x] consolidate writing, notes, planning into github / gitbook
* [x] put latest analysis code into git repo
* [x] write up null space variability thoughts as a next concrete step to test "full stack" data analysis, visualization, etc.

# Week 2 - Aug 7 - 13
* [X] Write draft outline of results, questions, hypotheses-- send to Brett and Tiago
* [X] Recreate behavior plots with s3 data -- trajectories

# Week 3 - Aug 14 - 20
* [X] plot outcomes, learning curves
* [X] Filter for subjects with certain outcomes (best, worst peformers)
* [X] Success metrics -- trajectory length
* [X] Segmenting trajectories, figure out how to do this and start testing

# Week 4 - Aug 21
* [X] Struggle mentally

# Week 5 - Aug 28
* [X] Struggle mentally

# BACKLOG
* [ ] Filter for trials with a particular target location
* [ ] Decoder -- plot decoder directions
* [ ] Success metrics -- trajectory curviness (define this, number of segments?)
* [ ] Controlled/Uncontrolled manifold variability plots, writing
* [ ] basic LQR comparison
* [ ] LQR with regularizer - how do you solve this numerically?
* [ ] system ID - how is this done?

# Week 6 - Sep 4
* [X] Get back on the payroll
* [ ] Be able to access data locally instead of s3 to work offline
* [ ] Confirm -- can I recreate the behavioral data with the decoder?
* [ ] Confirm -- what are the dynamics of the task? Does the dot return to the center if there's no force? (i.e. gravity, spring)
* [ ] Review results with Tiago
