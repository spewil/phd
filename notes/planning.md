# 2020 timeline

## January
LQG presentation

## February
first recorded units with the amplifier

## March
got the recording working decently
recorded some data, basic analysis
made online thesis page

## April
write lit review
draft data club presentation
prelim data analyses
build up online thesis to point people to at the data club

## May
data club demo
20th --> present
	- get feedback on questions / hypotheses / confounds / designs

### BEGIN CORONA ###

work on the the full setup
test the new rig / electrodes to collect?
tackle expanding the experimental throughput
outline first paper steps

## June
get new rig working (nowhere close)
hardware testing
run-up to paper / SfN

### END CORONA ###

## July
X 6-16 SfN abstract deadline
prioritize mechanicals
prioritize basic game software

## August
- get APT data
	- prelim analysis
	- slides for krakauer meeting
- get Goncalo on board
- working in Bonsai
- hardware 3D printing for band

## September
- for Krakauer meeting (24):
	- interesting theory takes on APT data
		- reward
		- dynamics
		- fitting control
		- statistics of learning

## October
X 24-28 SfN?
- Bonsai v0 done X
- rig hardware
	- arm electrode mechanicals
	- inquiry into electrode preamps
	- attach frame to table
	- attach arm to frame
- testing v1 rig

## November
- collect rig prelim data

## December
- go home, work on modeling
	- LQR control models
	- inverse optimal control
	- PPP-LQR model



# emotions

## when it feels tough
- experiment is great, will produce a great dataset
- math is hard and takes a lot of time
- you won't know what to model until you have a task and some data
	- then the task will need to be tweaked
- this task is expressive-- lots of modeling possibilities (like forcefields)

## what has dan said?
- get the rig working, collecting data
	- proof of principle
- get out a paper validating the setup, easing people into it
	- e.g. do synergies have a temporal component?
	- analyzing motor signals as dynamical
- then work out a specific experiment using the method
	- e.g. how is motor control learned?
	- track learning

# rig

### SOFTWARE
- basic BMI
	- timestamps / telemetry to file
- trial structure
- smooth / reliable plotting
- define hardware test (input-output timelag)
- plans for engineering work
- mappings
	- linear to control a dot
	- show the correlation cloud / dim reduction
		- PCA
		- dPCA
		- PPCA
		- FA
	- show that with training PCA components increase?

### ELECTRONICS
- make cables X
- test board X
- make board enclosure X
- order more intra/surface electrodes X

### MECHANICAL
- fixture for game playing v0
- attachment for table
	- for chair?
- monitor placement
- chair / seat?

### MODELING
