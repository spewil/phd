1. Basic overview of experiment and results
   1. Description of everything
2. Learning 
   1. Behavior statistics
      1. Hits
         1. Polar plot –– per target
      2. some directions are more difficult -- can still measure ability even without the hit
      3. Misses
      4. Time to hit
      5. does "no hold" correlate with success?
         1. total number
         2. next trial
   2. Trajectory statistics
      1. Length
      2. Noise / width of distribution?
      3. action distribution statistics vs ?
   3. What correlates with learning
      1. Aspects of the learning task itself
   4. Learning curves along (EMG) individual dimensions?
   5. To disambiguate model-based and model-free, look at "adjustments"-- online corrections
      1. find examples where noise or something deviates, and an adjustment is made
      2. have a rule for adjustments, and scrutinize the movements after the adjustment
      3. can we do this on multiple timescales?
      4. find a space where adjustments stand out (e.g. velocity?)
   6. EMG space
      1. "null" and "non-null" space? How do we find each of these? How do we interpret the high-dim null space?
   7. Calibration statistics
      1. strategies low-to-high or high-to-low? (total force)
      2. any features across trials? (same strategy?)
      3. is the calibration the same each time?
      4. (the target bar order will be different, but the layout is the same?)
      5. Score?        
   8. Movement
      1. SNR of baseline signal? correlates with success?
      2. classifier training on natural movement data?
      3. to then classify initial movements?
   9. Hierarchy?
      1. dimensionality over time?
      2. What is a module? 
      3. How many discrete movements? (behavioral modularity)
   10. Force
      1. Higher force initially (in calibration) seems to mean difficulty later
      2. E.g. andrei -- level of required force?
   11. Random Correlates
      1. Time of day
      2. plot arm size vs X
      3. plot overall force / variance vs X
      4. coffee drinkers and non
      5. hours from lunch
      6. sleep hours


3. Analyses of learning
   1. EMG→behavior
   2. What / how are people learning?
      1. E.g. trial-to-trial reward
      2. What happens after rewarded trials (on average)
   3. What errors are at play?
      1. Prediction error (prediction of target?)
      2. Error in EMG space and in behavior space
   4. first movement (of each block?) as a plan/feedforward?
   5. Games’ modes (NMF factors, decoder)
      1. directions of modes relative to targets correlate with performance?
      2. alignment of dominant modes with target directions
      3. dominant modes-- projections of random emg? eigendirections?
      4. alignment = cosine distance
      5. you could get lucky where the principle directions are directly to targets... in this case, do you keep doing what you're doing? or do you hone in the movement?
   6. Bottleneck between trajectory (or some feature thereof) and target?
      1. how well can we predict target from trajectory? or vice versa?
      2. I.e. how well can subjects infer motor activations given target (the policy)?
   7. Freezing DoFs?
      1. How many e.g. PCA components are active at once, how does this change over time?
   8. “structure of variability”
      1. Which dimensions / space does variability live in?
      2. How does this change over trials?
   9. Modularity
      1. which dimensions are controlled?
      2. Controlled here maybe means lower variability… or it means more responsive to errors? Might be the same thing…
   10. agonist/antagonist pairs
      1. movements and their opposites are a strong prior!
      2. Can we connect modes to behavioral directions? 


4. Models of learning
   1. Why are people learning what they’re learning?
   2. Why are people learning how they’re learning
   3. what OFC model would fit the data at each point?
      1. reconstruct / fit the best controller?


Misc Thoughts


People tend to make other movements over learning, of the head and body, of the other hand. This may aid in memory of particular movements? No way to measure this, but it’s an interesting observation – the synergy extends beyond the hand, maybe as a memory device.


Misc Data Notes 


Data Organization
* how to ignore no-holds...?
* query the data without holding it in memory? (API for the data, effectively) – reliquery!
[a]Organize these, sort them, turn them into tangible plots, e.g. "Plot this on the x versus that on y" or "histograms of x values"
