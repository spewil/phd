ideas for future experiments

- better use of the data manifold, more calibration / training data to get a full picture of subject's manifold
- fewer targets, maybe just one, where the contingency is the decoder
- make the decoder "easy" and "hard" using PCA or similar technique to force people to use different subspaces, ones that align and misalign with their data manifold
-
