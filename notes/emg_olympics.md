# questions

- do you play any sports?
- do you play any instruments?
- do you do anything with your hands that might imply increased dexterity?
- how did you find the tasks?
- what strategy, if any, would you say you used during the session?
- which movements were important for solving the reaching task?

# messaging / recruitment

If you volunteer to participate in this study, you will be asked to do the following:
• Allow experimenters to attach a 64-channel electrode array to your dominant forearm. This requires the application of a small amount of conductive gel.
• Place your dominant arm into an experimental rig consisting of an elbow rest, wrist rest, and glove-like hand constraint.
• Follow instructions to perform the feedback task. You will be asked to activate muscles controlling your fingers and wrist to move a cursor on the screen towards a goal.
• Commit to several sessions of daily training.
The electromyography recordings of your activities made during this research will be used only for analysis and for illustration in conference presentations and lectures. These recordings cannot be used to identify you in any way. No other personal data will be collected for the purposes of this experiment.

feel free to opt-out of the competition but still take part, or to take part in the competition anonymously

# rewards 

25£ per session
100£ prize for the competition winner 

# interview 

- age, sex
- medical issues with muscles, hands, etc.?
- do you play sports?
- do you play any instruments?
- how well do you think you performed?
- what strategies did you use to improve?

# analysis

- explain the setup, shape of the data
- track dimensionality across learning
- disentangle model-based / model-free
- confirm optimality for expert participants
- build a picture of how people are reaching optimality
- is this strategy / dynamic conserved across participants?
- track learning rates along different dimensions (null space?)

# followups

- tracking task (pure feedback control?)
- cursor perturbation mid-reach (for different targets? like OFC)
- target jump
