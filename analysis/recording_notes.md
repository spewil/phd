longer pauses for bar task
30min to end of calibration 1
1h to end of center hold 1
1.5hr to start of center hold 3
1.75hr to end

explain the whole experiment at the top
2 sessions of movement
2 sessions of calibration
3 sessions of game
pauses in between

something crashed at session 31 such that there are only 8 trials in this session
probably just take the three outstanding trials from the next session?

a lot of postural adjustments to hit targets to the left, box sliding around everywhere
are these necessary or do they help you remember?
holding is great for people to relax (for fatigue, composure, etc)
fatigue could be a big part of things (how to infer?)
hierarchy within trajectory-- get close, then wiggle?
variability of behavior parallel to and orthogonal to the target direction?

left side is difficult (for everyone?)

loose band? having trouble with blood flow
small forces in the movements
small forces in first calibration

arthur
offset x = 0.29
offset y = -0.023
thinks that remembering movements is the difficult part, not executing them. 
isolated mapping to two fingers, mostly
some fatigue after first center hold
arthur is generally fidgety!

new electrodes

messed up the order of the modes... they don't match the first round :(

hand fatigue by the 3rd center hold session

holly2
new electrodes
offset x = -0.121
offset y = 0.025
0123 -- 2310
old order 0312 --> 2031
after block 28, we moved the wrist strap to the elbow
signal seemed very clean after a test visualization
this was due to holly's wrist issue causing numbness in her hand
told her only to continue if she was not in any pain

new electrodes (small band)

zeynib
didnt note offsets
new electrodes
moved a lot during the first movement session
second session i think was better
calibration task high force?
used the first calibration dataset -- something weird in the second?
having some trouble holding... posture?
major sample drops towards the end of session 1... not sure why?
had to change the offsets because of holding in session 3
adjusted handed after session 1, and offsets
after session 18, we stopped quickly to move the hand constraint as the electrodes were being pressed!
restart at session 19
this fixed the no-holding problem.
rest after session 32 (33 start)

brought up a good point:
is it important that I hit the red dot?
assuming she was thinking of a high-level strategy of exploring first
what are people actually optimizing for?

not sure about the offsets

band doesnt fit around the arm
stretch and use the bandage
missing the ventral stripe (flexors?)
offset x = 0.162s
offset y = -0.51
stop after 37 because of battery issues!!!!
previous few trials had major lag...
started ~ 10 trials into the third session, lasted 20 trials
changed the offset for the last session to 0.2

big break after calibration, adjusting electrodes

extra session to account for this
