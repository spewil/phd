0. enter subject details, arrange filepaths appropriately
   1. make a data folder for each subject, with experimental not
   2. make subject info json (to be picked up by python later)
1. clean and prep arm
   1. soap and water, scrub
2. attach electrodes at a fixed position
   1. measure arm at ulnar styloid
   2. measure arm 5cm from elbow tip
   3. where to place band?
3. set up arm in enclosure, attach ground
4. test recording
   1. **validation: visual inspection of data**
      1. noise
      2. electrode liftoff / seating
      3. in case of issues, adjust sleeve etc. accordingly
5. explain natural movement task
   1. you will be asked to perform a series of movements:
      1. read each movement and demonstrate
      2. try to the best of your ability
      3. don't need to use maximum force, approx 50% of maximum at peak
   2. once the subject is ready, the task (rest + movements) is run 3 times
6. bar calibration task
   1. you will be asked to perform an exploration and isolation task
   2. you will see 64 vertical bars on your screen
   3. your movements cause the bars to change height
   4. the goal of each trial is to maximize the height of the red bar whilst minimizing the height of all other bars
   5. to the best of your ability
7. scripts are run to produce modes and choose decoder
   1. **validation: modes are visually inspected**
   2. if an error is seen, emg is checked, calibration is repeated
   3. if modes look reasonable, continue to task
8. center hold task
   1. you will be asked to move a dot to target locations on the screen using muscles controlling your hand movements. first you must hold the dot in the center of the screen for a required time, after which a trial will begin. each trial you will attempt to move the dot towards the target and hold it there for a desired time. if you are successful, a new trial will begin. if you run out of time, a new trial will begin.
- run task for desired number of trials for a range of targets.
- after each run, briefly interview the subject about discomfort, feeling, strategies, glaring errors (only doing one movement), etc.
