            <!-- Muscles are composed of fibers which contract due to chemical gradients produced at the neuromuscular junction by action potentials emanating from alpha-motoneurons (AMN) in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. The quantum of motor output is the motor unit (MU), defined as a single motoneuron axon and the set of junctions its axon branches form with one or more muscle fibers. The innervation ratio of a particular muscle unit is the number of junctions it innervates.

            <p>The quantum of motor output is the motor unit (MU), defined as a single motoneuron axon and the set of junctions the terminals of its axon branches form with one or more muscle fibers. The MU provides the motor system with spatial redundancy at the muscle level: multiple muscle fibers contract due to a single alpha motoneuron (AMN) spike in the spinal cord’s ventral horn, and multiple AMNs may overlap in their innervations. The forces produced by motor units span several orders of magnitude, though most units produce very small forces. Here we find temporal redundancy: in order to produce movements, MUs combine to generate a range of forces<span class="citation" data-cites="fuglevandMechanicalPropertiesNeural2011"><sup><a href="#ref-fuglevandMechanicalPropertiesNeural2011" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></sup></span>. Since the innervation ratios of muscles in the forearm and hand are relatively small compared to more proximal muscles (which contain thousands of MUs), the logarithmic recruitment and redundancy of motor units enables the hand to produce movements with very fine spatiotemporal resolution.</p>
            <!-- Paradoxically, however, the well-known signal-dependent noise in models of motor output has been found to be higher for hand muscles than for more proximal muscles, likely due to small numbers of motor units compare to larger muscles[@harrisSignaldependentNoiseDetermines1998;@fuglevandMechanicalPropertiesNeural2011]. -->
            <p>Muscle fibers are contained within muscle compartments, and each muscle may have one or more compartments. The fingers of the hand are extended by the extensor digitorum (ED) which contains four compartments, one for each of the tendons the muscle produces. Each tendon connects to the three metaphalangeal joints of each digit. The fingers are flexed by two muscles, the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP). Like the ED, these muscles produce four tendons, one to each finger from each of their four compartments. As such, one must coactivate these agonist and antagonist muscles in order to extend or flex a single finger in isolation<span class="citation" data-cites="fuglevandMechanicalPropertiesNeural2011"><sup><a href="#ref-fuglevandMechanicalPropertiesNeural2011" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></sup></span>. Adduction and abduction of the fingers is produced by the 19 intrinsic muscles of the hand, each of which has their origin and insertion points within the hand itself<span class="citation" data-cites="vanduinenConstraintsControlHuman2011"><sup><a href="#ref-vanduinenConstraintsControlHuman2011" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></sup></span>. The intrinsic muscle tendons form a kind of network around each of the digits. The human hand, thumb, and forearm system contains more than 30 muscles and at least 20 degrees of freedom are theoretically available for actuation. However, due to biomechanical coupling, the effective degrees of freedom is presumably less than 20.</p>
            <!-- One study found that tendons of the fingers are arranged in such a way as to perform a kind of anatomical computation which expands the mechanical capabilities of the appendage by sharing force across its tendon network[@Valero-Cuevas2007].

            These redundancies at the neurophysiological level play a role in "spillover", where contractions of one muscle or muscle compartment seem to spill over into neighboring muscles and muscle compartments. This is evident in the difficulty of moving single fingers individually. As mentioned previously, this may be a hardwired constraint or a byproduct of plasticity induced by behavioral requirements. 

            > Spillover has been shown in experiments studying the ‘recruitment thresholds’ (defined below) of motor units ac ting on other digits during single digit contractions (Kilbreath & Gandevia, 1994; Butler et al. 2005; van Duinen et al. 2009). In these experiments, motor units were recorded from one (test) compartment of the respective muscles, while subjects were asked to contract the compartment of the other digits up to 50% of their maximal force. When the subjects contracted these other digits (one by one), motor units of the test compartment were often recruited. The amount of force produced by the other digits at the time of recruitment of the motor unit of the test compartment is termed the recruitment threshold. The general finding for all three muscles was that, the closer the contracting compartment to the test finger, the more motor units were recruited. [...] One has to ask whether this spillover is functional. Is the frequent recruitment of motor units ac ting on the little finger when we extend the thumb part of a fixed pattern of muscle activation, perhaps to balance forces around the wrist? (Duinen & Gandevia 2011)

            <!-- 
            http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Motor_coordination

            Coordination between two or more effectors (muscles, joints, limbs, or even different people) occurs when the motor commands to one effector depend (in a causal or statistical sense) on the state of the other effector(s). Coordination is goal-directed; the interdependency of movements promotes the achievement of a behavioral task. 

            The term “synergy” is often introduced to explain coordination across different muscles. As a descriptive term, a synergy simply refers to the strong regularities in the spatiotemporal pattern of muscle commands, and the observation that large portions of the variance of recorded muscle activity can be described by a small number of linear components (d'Avella et al. 2006). As an explanatory term, a synergy refers to a neural controller that produces the correlated pattern of muscle activity. 

            In the framework of Optimal Feedback Control, coordination in both feed-forward and feedback control is achieved by making the control policy of one effector dependent on an internal estimate of the state of another effector (Todorov et al. 2002, Diedrichsen et al. 2010). The difference between feed-forward or feedback control within this framework is gradual, and simply reflects the fact that the state estimate is informed by an internal prediction in the former, and actual sensory information in the latter case. 

            -->
            <!-- Nikolai Bernstein coined the phrase "the degrees-of-freedom problem" to describe the challenge the motor system faces in coordinating its many dimension to achieve a goal. Solving this problem requires dexterity [@Bernstein1967]. As we have seen, redundancy is present from joints and muscles to motor units and their upstream synaptic partners. However, rather than asking how the motor control system deals with this "problem" overwhelming complexity, we might instead question why this complexity evolved at all. What does the availability of this redundancy afford the motor system? How does this redundancy enable dexterous movement? -->
            <!-- The term motor synergy can be used descriptively to describe the spatiotemporal coactivation of muscles necessary for an ongoing task. -->
            <!-- A considerable amount of discussion has focused on the existence of synergies as a simplifying structure which allows the motor system to "solve" the redundancy "problem". Synergetic control implies control in the space of a low-dimensional set of synergy weights rather than independent control over the actuator dimensions themselves. The control dimensions are functionally coupled as a result of synergetic action, which both simplifies the control task and constrains behavior to the low-dimensional subspace defined by the synergy weights[@merelHierarchicalMotorControl2019]. This is what Bizzi and colleagues refer to as "the puppet's strings". The term can also be used as a normative model of motor coordination which implies a constraint in the dimensionality of the descending supraspinal control signal, the simplifying movements of the puppeteer. -->
            <p>Many studies have contributed to the concept of synergies as a hard-wired organizing feature of the motor system<span class="citation" data-cites="mussa-ivaldiMotorLearningCombination2000"><sup><a href="#ref-DAvella2003" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span>. However, these works tend to extrapolate from non-primate preparations, particularly in the frog, and use tasks which are inherently low-dimensional to explain covariance structure in primate and human kinematic and electromyography data<span class="citation" data-cites="giszterMotorPrimitivesNew2015 gao2017"><sup><a href="#ref-giszterMotorPrimitivesNew2015" role="doc-biblioref">6</a>,<a href="#ref-gao2017" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></sup></span>. That said, it would be foolish to deny the existence of synergistic muscle coactivation even at the structural level. Careful studies of force control by the fingertips present a complex story of dimensionality of control in this regime<span class="citation" data-cites="raczSpatiotemporalAnalysisReveals2013"><sup><a href="#ref-raczSpatiotemporalAnalysisReveals2013" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></sup></span>. Constraints exist in the architecture of the hand as well as its control system, though we maintain that concept of synergies, especially in the context of dexterous movement, is often presented as an oversimplification rather than a mere simplification. We believe the story of the hand is more complex.</p>
            <p>Studies have attempted to quantify the number of effective degrees of freedom of the hand with various methods. This has primarily been taken to be the number of linear features which contain a desired level of the original signal variance, where the signal is the joint angles of the hand engaged in various behaviors<span class="citation" data-cites="Ingram2009 TodorovDimensionality2005"><sup><a href="#ref-Ingram2009" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>,<a href="#ref-TodorovDimensionality2005" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></sup></span>. These methods have resulted in roughly 8 linear features of hand kinematics to solve a variety of tasks, with subtleties found in inter-task and inter-subject variations. Note that the motor repertoire is hardly high-dimensional when compared to the dimensionality of the visual feature extraction system<span class="citation" data-cites="yanUnexpectedComplexityEveryday2020"><sup><a href="#ref-yanUnexpectedComplexityEveryday2020" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></sup></span>. A recent study found that low-variance linear, kinematic components displayed significantly higher correlation within condition (e.g. grasp of a specific object) than across condition. This suggests that these components carry task-dependent information rather than condition-independent, task-irrelevant noise<span class="citation" data-cites="yanUnexpectedComplexityEveryday2020"><sup><a href="#ref-yanUnexpectedComplexityEveryday2020" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></sup></span>. This suggests that the control of the hand is more nuanced than a set of fixed synergies.</p>
            <p>What Bizzi and colleagues call “the problem of supraspinal pattern formation”–how synergies are activated through time– we argue, in the context of hand control, is not simplified by the existence of hard-wired or soft-wired synergies<span class="citation" data-cites="bizziMotorPlanningExecution2020"><sup><a href="#ref-bizziMotorPlanningExecution2020" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></sup></span>. Rather, the CNS produces control signals in a range of contexts and in response to continually changing task demands. Rather than the CNS “simplifying movement” through synergetic action, it is more likely that hand synergies fall out of a optimization strategy which trades off effort and accuracy where effort may, in part, correspond to independent control of individual control dimensions. In this view, synergies, hard-wired or not, reflect the statistics of the environment in which movement is constructed<span class="citation" data-cites="brutonSynergiesCoordinationComprehensive2018"><sup><a href="#ref-brutonSynergiesCoordinationComprehensive2018" role="doc-biblioref">12</a></sup></span>. If we limit ourselves to synergetic control, then we have simply passed the problem to a lower-dimensional one of the same fundamental nature. Neural control of the hand likely contains a spectrum of modularity in order to maintain its role as a flexible instrument. Synergetic action is one end of this spectrum resulting from the computations inherent to, along with the structures of the human movement machine.</p>
            <h2 data-number="1.3" id="fractionating-structures"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Fractionating Structures</h2>
            <!-- with CM connections, how synergies might they not be as rigid as we think when we're talking about the hand -->
            <!-- At the other end of the spectrum, years of research has contributed to a more complex picture of hand function which embraces non-synergistic movement[@lemon1993;@lemon1997;@lemon2008]. The key insight of the work is that while "the organization of the spinal cord is based on relatively rigid muscular modes, a mechanism to fractionate this is of particular importance for the muscles of the hands and digits which may need to be employed in a variety of flexible associations during voluntary movements." Careful anatomical work has shown how monosynaptic corticospinal, or corticomotoneuronal (CM), connections provide such fractionation in primates which use tools requiring dexterity[@lemonStartingStoppingMovement2019]. M connections are specific to the primate corticospinal tract and specific to distal muscles of the hands and arm. It appears that the rodent CST contains CM connections until they recede around P10 at which point they recede[@kawasawa2017;@murabe2018]. -->
            <p>Just as many muscle fibers may be innervated by a single AMN, up to thousands of neurons contact single AMNs through monosynaptic corticospinal, or corticomotoneuronal (CM), connections and other descending pathways through elaborate spinal circuitry. The hallmark of CM connections in particular is their influence over multiple muscle compartments as well as multiple muscles, though typically agonist or antagonist sets<span class="citation" data-cites="cheneyFunctionalClassesPrimate1980"><sup><a href="#ref-cheneyFunctionalClassesPrimate1980" role="doc-biblioref">13</a></sup></span>. This may seem counter-intuitive as a means to produce individuated movement, but experimental evidence in primates has shown that the convergence of many CM collateral fibers onto single AMNs driving the distal muscles in particular can produce a fine grading of activity over motor units driving the distal joints. CM cells also appear to play a role in the inhibition of antagonist muscles prior to contractions required for movement.<span class="citation" data-cites="griffinMotorCortexUses2020"><sup><a href="#ref-griffinMotorCortexUses2020" role="doc-biblioref">14</a></sup></span> These findings confirm theories about the excitatory and inhibitory role of these connections dating back decades, and combine to suggest that variables encoded in cortical ensembles are more complex than kinematics or dynamics alone<span class="citation" data-cites="cheneyFunctionalClassesPrimate1980"><sup><a href="#ref-cheneyFunctionalClassesPrimate1980" role="doc-biblioref">13</a></sup></span>.</p>
            <p>The CM tract thus acts in coordination with synergistic muscle activations of the hand to achieve control that is balanced between modularity and flexibility. Findings suggest that there is a bipartite structure in human motor cortex driving dexterous control of the distal part of the upper limb which, it has been suggested, evolved under pressure to quickly generalize between tasks. This work argues that these two streams of hand control, namely “fractionated” and “synergistic” control, may interact to produce versatility, and balancing these subsystems may be a key part of the optimization function when learning new skills<span class="citation" data-cites="Rathelot2009 griffinCorticomotoneuronalCellsAre2015 Takei2017"><sup><a href="#ref-Rathelot2009" role="doc-biblioref">15</a>–<a href="#ref-Takei2017" role="doc-biblioref">17</a></sup></span>. This dualism is likely not rigidly dichotomous, but rather a spectrum of overriding fractionation (so-called “New M1”) atop a phylogenetically older system of synergistic action<span class="citation" data-cites="dumCorticospinalSystemStructural2011"><sup><a href="#ref-dumCorticospinalSystemStructural2011" role="doc-biblioref">18</a></sup></span>. Griffin and colleagues found that CM cells are functionally tuned to a muscle’s mode of activity (agonist, antagonist, fixator) to “bypass spinal cord mechanisms and sculpt novel patterns of motor output that are essential for highly skilled movements”<span class="citation" data-cites="griffinCorticomotoneuronalCellsAre2015"><sup><a href="#ref-griffinCorticomotoneuronalCellsAre2015" role="doc-biblioref">16</a></sup></span>. The hypothesis stemming from the previously described work is that CM connections override the “consolidated” patterns putatively generated via spinal interneuron circuitry. The setup devised in our work aims to measure fractionation by tracing motor unit correlations across learning. Whether fractionation in our experiments is due to the CM pathway can only be speculation, but our work may provide direction for future studies pairing intracortical recordings with careful electromyography.</p>
            <!-- Individual corticomotoneurons contact multiple motor pools, and rarely (if ever) individual motor neurons. -->
            <!-- > It is generally believed that the direct corticomotoneuronal (CM) pathway, which is a phylogenetically newer pathway in higher primates, plays a critical role in the fractionation of muscle activity during dexterous hand movements. However, the present study demonstrated that PreM-INs, which are phylogenetically older, have spatiotemporal properties that correlate with muscle synergies during voluntary hand movements. Therefore, it is likely that these two systems have specialized functions for the control of primate hand movements, namely “fractionated control” and “synergistic control,” respectively. The interaction of these two putative control systems might be the source of the exceptional versatility of primate hand movements. [...] Optimization of balanced control may be an important factor also for the acquisition of new motor skills [@Takei2017]. -->
            <!-- The degree to which fractionation of movement is learned is unknown. Skilled piano performers have been found to exhibit a higher degree of independent movement among the fingers compared to control participants. Control groups displayed a hierarchical, presumably lower dimensional, organization of finger movement patterns while pianists showed distinct but individuated movement patterns[@furuyaFlexibilityMovementOrganization2013]. These results are imply that with skilled practice humans can produce finer and more independent movements of the fingers, and construct bespoke coactivations to solve specific goals. Similarly, studies have found that coherence between the index finger and thumb is greater on the dominant hand. This might imply a developmental lateralization, but use-dependent plasticity due to greater precision grip behavior of the dominant hand is also a viable explanation[@fuglevandMechanicalPropertiesNeural2011]. -->
            <!-- The concept of a balanced control may prove to be a fruitful direction for theoretical work on dexterous motor control, the goal being to construct a model which takes into account this spectrum of individuation into account. The experimental challenge is to identify tasks which ostensibly require the direct descending connections to fractionate learned synergies. There is work suggesting that CM connections synapse primarily on low threshold, low force motor units that are recruited first. This would imply a difference in synergy fractionation at lower force as opposed to higher force. This can be tested easily by including a force parameter in a hand control task. The hypothesis stemming from the previously described work is that CM connections override the "consolidated" patterns putatively generated via spinal interneuron circuitry. -->

            <p>It is known from recent work that primary motor cortex (M1) is not an isolated movement-generating dynamical system, but rather a node in the network of a feedback-modulated, distributed movement machine<span class="citation" data-cites="sauerbreiCorticalPatternGeneration2019"><sup><a href="#ref-sauerbreiCorticalPatternGeneration2019" role="doc-biblioref">19</a></sup></span>. Thinking of the structural architecture of M1 as an input-driven system with outputs along a spectrum of modularity from synergistic to fractionated, we can ask what kind of functional architecture might have evolved in the neuromuscular controller? Graziano and colleagues found that 500ms electrical stimulation to M1 reliably produced stereotyped movements in primates<span class="citation" data-cites="graziano2006"><sup><a href="#ref-graziano2006" role="doc-biblioref">20</a></sup></span>. These movements appeared to produce goal-oriented actions pulled out of other contexts such as bringing food to the mouth, and seemed to be arranged on the cortical sheet topographically in terms of spatial endpoints rather than as a humunculus. Graziano refers to this as the cortical “action map”, that these stimulations tapped into the control mechanisms of the primate’s motor system<span class="citation" data-cites="grazianoIntelligentMovementMachine2009"><sup><a href="#ref-grazianoIntelligentMovementMachine2009" role="doc-biblioref">21</a></sup></span>.

            <p>The motor map concept suggests interpreting activity in M1 as a field of feedback control microcircuits, integrating and transforming inputs, both internal and external, to sculpt ongoing movement<span class="citation" data-cites="wiltschkoMappingSubSecondStructure2015"><sup><a href="#ref-wiltschkoMappingSubSecondStructure2015" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>wiltschkoMappingSubSecondStructure2015?</strong></a></sup></span>. This is in accordance with the idea that there is a structural hierarchy in M1 covering a spectrum of movement modularity. These ideas together form a picture of the motor system as a structural scaffold upon which behaviorally relevant feedback mappings from cortex to the spinal cord are continuously activated and modulated based on information and estimates about the periphery. In this view, the encoded variables of interest depend on the goals, context, and perturbations of the intended movement.

            <blockquote>
            <p>“The usefulness of a feedback-dependent mapping from cortex to muscles is that it can in principle allow neurons in motor cortex to control a diversity of movement variables, such as direction, speed, hand position, or posture that transcend a fixed pattern of muscle activation. If the network receives feedback information about a specific movement variable, then it can learn to control that variable.”</p>

            <!-- **A traditional view of the neuronal machinery of movement control is that activity at a site in motor cortex propagates down a fixed pathway through the spinal cord, activating a set of muscles. Based on our stimulation results, however, the underlying mechanism seems to be less of a simple feed-forward pathway and more of a network. The effect of the network is to create a specific class of mapping from the cortex to the muscles, a mapping that can change continuously on the basis of feedback about the state of the periphery. If the periphery is relatively still, the mapping from cortex to muscles appears fixed and resembles the traditional view. But once the state of the periphery is allowed to vary as in natural movement, the mapping from cortex to muscles becomes somewhat fluid in a manner that facilitates complex movement control.** [@grazianoIntelligentMovementMachine2009] -->
            <p>Muscle activity is, in this sense, a readout from a network transforming state-dependent inputs into movement goals. Rather than choosing muscle patterns in reconfigurable blocks, it creatively constructs and sculpts movement. The hierarchy of the motor system may not be rigidly organized around a particular set of variables. As shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:motor_system">3</a>, many loops exist connecting cortex with the spinal cord, the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, and the sensorimotor periphery. Each of these loops contributes information for the flexible activation of the relevant action maps. Put simply, prevailing evidence suggests that cerebellar loops provide predictive state information while basal gangliar loops provide state and/or action value information. Taken together, this work provides an image of the incredible complexity which generates dexterous movements of the hand. This is the foundation on which we can work to build experiments which elucidate the computations involved in the production of skilled movement. We aim to connect our results back to what is known about the system we are attempting to reverse-engineer in order to inspire future inquiries into the inner workings of the movement machine.</p>

            > We considered the idea that the structure of activation patterns is determined by the way we use our hands in everyday life15. Our everyday activities and interactions with objects impose a strong correlation structure on our finger movements16,17. For example, the middle and the ring fingers often move together to facilitate grasping, whereas the thumb typically moves independently10.

            > We predicted that frequently co-occurring finger movements would lead to strong associations between the cortical modules that encode them. When an individual finger is moved, activation would automatically spread to these associated circuits. Thus, the hand- usage model predicts that fingers that often move together would also be associated with similar activation patterns.

            > if the cortex had simply evolved to optimally activate neural synergies that are encoded in the spinal cord, then M1 would have to produce two very different activity patterns to individuate two fingers that normally move together

            they're saying that natural hand use does dictate both the output (via stimulation) as well as the topographic layout of the representational map in motor cortex-- saying here if its just choosing synergies, the map could be whatever it wanted on the cortical sheet, just needs to choose the right pattern for the right synergies, but these results suggest that the representation is driven by movement statistics, through learning or development 

            Motor cortical cells (many of which have corticospinal projections) discharge with movement of more than one digit and those associated with a particular movement are not tightly clustered. The corticospinal projection provides a further complication because the axons branch to supply more than one motor nucleus (Shinoda et al. 1981). These overlapping areas in the motor cortex may be optimal for daily usage of the hand, but also constrain the ability to control the digits independently. -->
            <!-- **I added this on Friday:** {+@fig:strick_graziano} depicts the hierarchical nature of the motor system that enables its dexterity. The motor system is tuned to produce varying levels of modularity, and this is shown in Rasthelot's work at a structural level: CM cells evolved to provide modifications to coarse, synergistic action. This is reflected in Graziano's work where, loosely, more dexterous behaviors are produced when stimulation is applied to the caudal regions of motor cortex. These dexterous behaviors are driven by a hierarchical stack of cellular machinery, each level of which is modulated by estimated state, goals, uncertainty, and value. -->
            <!-- The movement machine reasons in the space of feedback control systems and their ensuing trajectories. The phenomenal thing about the motor system is that it is able to tune itself rapidly with both high-dimensional sensory inputs and sparse reward signals[@bahlNeuralDynamicPoliciesfor2020;@ijspeertDynamicalMovementPrimitives2013]. This has some precedence in the literature and will be discussed further in {+@sec:theory}. This section has attempted to illustrate the complexity of the motor control system specifically with regard to dexterous control of the hand, with an eye toward experimental and theoretical avenues for exploration. The goal is to build and test a theoretical scheme for aspects of the compositional nature of the neural hand controller. -->

            Looking at rapid visuomotor responses, this work found that these reflexive movement were modulated by the value of multiple goals, just as in cognitive tasks. This supports the idea that there exists flexibility at all "levels" of the hierarchy, all recieving similar feedbacks and all similarly modulated by context:

            > If low-level sensorimotor circuits can contribute to value- based decisions through continuous feedback control, rather than merely executing the outcome of discrete action decisions taken in higher-order brain areas, it would support for the hy- pothesis that value-based decision algorithms are distributed throughout multiple levels of sensorimotor and cognitive pro- cessing hierarchies (Hunt et al., 2014; Hunt and Hayden, 2017). This notion differs from the traditional view that decisions arise from a serial process with modular units for choice evaluation, value comparison and action selection. According to the alterna- tive view, the basis for decisions is mutual inhibition between neural representations of alternative options, and these compu- tations occur simultaneously in multiple brain areas along both motor and abstract-value dimensions of tasks (Wang, 2012). Our current evidence that value-based decisions can be implemented through sensorimotor feedback control supports the alternative view, and the general notion that behavior emerges via a distributed consensus between circuits engaged nominally in decision and sensorimotor processes (Cisek, 2012). [@carrollRapidVisuomotorResponses2019]


            > When we move, the brain specifies a set of feedback control gains that enable low-level motor areas not only to generate efficient and accurate movement, but also to rapidly and adaptively respond to evolving sensory information in a manner consistent with value-based decision-making.[@carrollRapidVisuomotorResponses2019]


            Spinal stretch reflexes may also be modulated by posture, like in Graziano's work:

            > We found that changing the arm’s orientation diametrically altered how spinal reflexes in the elbow muscles were evoked, and in such a way that were again efficiently scaled to the hand’s distance from the target. These findings demonstrate that spinal circuits can help efficiently control the hand during dynamic reaching actions, and show that efficient and flexible motor control is not exclusively dependent on processing that occurs within supraspinal regions of the nervous system.[@weiler2020]

            This is supported by another paper:

            > Our results reveal complex goal-dependent modulation of fast feedback responses in M1 that are present early enough to account for goal-dependent stretch responses in arm muscles [@pruszynski2014]

            Feedback and internal dynamics play a role, and models reflect either (in this model they forgo sensory feedback, which we see as integral to modulating feedback control):

            > Sensory feedback takes at least 25 ms to influence cortical responses and >50 ms to reflect the current goal. Thus, during this ~200-ms interval, the neural dynamics are not yet affected by sensory feedback and should presumably be explained via internal dynamics. This is true even of optimal feed- back control architectures, which employ a dynamically varying control policy and internal ‘efference-copy’ recurrence to generate time-varying output patterns before the arrival of feedback. Given the practical choice to use a model without sensory feedback, we verified with additional simulations that the solutions found by the model were robust to the addition of reasonable forms of feedback [@sussillo2015]

            Andy has written that sensory and spinal systems work "in parallel", but do we agree with this?

            > In terrestrial mammals, the rhythmic and coordinated leg movements during locomotion are controlled by a combination of interconnected neurons in the spinal cord, referred as to the central pattern generator, and sensory feedback from the segmental somatosensory system and supraspinal centers such as the vestibular system. How segmental somatosensory and the vestibular systems work in parallel to enable terrestrial mammals to locomote in a natural environment is still relatively obscure.

            <!-- Muscle Spindles -- proprioceptive feedback during movement

            Arm  movements  are  sensed  via  distributed  and  individually  ambiguous  activity  patterns  of  muscle  spindles,which depend on relative joint configurations rather than the absolute hand position.  Interpreting this high dimensional  input  (around  50  muscles  for  a  human  arm)  of  distributed information at the relevant behavioral level poses a challenging  decoding  problem  for  the  central  nervous  system. Proprioceptive information from the receptors undergoes several  processing  steps  before  reaching  somatosensory  cortex (3,8) - from the spindles that synapse in Clarke’s nucleus, to cuneate nucleus, thalamus (3,9), and finally to somatosensory cortex (S1).   In cortex,  a number of tuning properties have been observed, such as responsiveness to varied combinations of joints and muscle lengths (10,11), sensitivity to different loads and angles (12), and broad and unimodal tuning for movement direction during arm movements (11,13).The proprioceptive information in S1 is then hypothesized to serve as the basis of a wide variety of tasks, via its connections to motor cortex and higher somatosensory processing regions.

            <!-- ## The Heterarchical Motor System -->
            <!-- Motor circuitsthat support online control are highly distributed, includingmany cortical and subcortical regions. Many different regionslikely contribute to each process, and a single brain regionmay participate in multiple processes.38Thus, it is highly unlikelythat a single brain region is exclusively responsible for a singleparameter or control process.For example, the control policy in which motor commands aregenerated based on the present state of the body likely involvescortical, brainstem, and spinal processing, because each levelcontributes to a certain degree to the final pattern of muscle ac-tivity during a motor action. The final motor command onlyemerges at the motoneuronal level (the final common path)51as some descending projections synapse directly onto moto-neurons.52This distributed and hierarchical organization meansthat the contribution at the highest cortical level will not simplyreflect the pattern of muscle activity for a motor action. Thus,temporary deactivation in any of these brain regions involved infeedback control could lead to impairments that look like areduction in control policy gains. 

            PMd [premotor cortex] has strong projectionsto M1, brainstem, and spinal cord.62–64Thus, deactivation inthis cortical region indirectly impacts feedback performanceby altering other regions that are part of the control policy.38Alternatively, PMd may be more directly involved in online con-trol. Previous work highlights that this brain region responds inas little as 25 ms to mechanical disturbances of the limb, andthis pattern of activity is altered based on behavioral context.15

            It is also interesting to note that reductions in parameters associated with the forward model led to large errors even forsmall reductions in gain and even oscillatory behavior for reductions at50%

            Although OFC models proved useful for cortical circuits, more biological-inspired hierarchicalmodels will likely be necessary to interpret how the disruptionof brainstem and spinal circuits impact control.

            > Many examples of neural networks applied to control problems use “end-to-end” optimization25; that is, there is a single task objective, and the entirety of the architecture maximizes this singular objective. However, the broad alternative is that control systems have some functional separation of roles by subsystem, and different modules benefit from being trained by distinct modular objectives. A specific, practical, and popular approach trains a controller to solve a task while also training a set of internal representations to predict future sensory data26,55,56. This approach to learning internal state representa- tions can improve experience efficiency by leveraging dense self- supervised objectives to train perceptual and memory modules, whereas task reward can still provide learning signals for the controller. This approach is “heterarchical” insofar as different objective functions, consisting of a predictive objective as well as a policy improvement objective, are imposed in parallel on different parts of the overall network architecture.

Since the same interneurones also receive con -tinuous input from sensory receptors (and hence might be thought to participate in spinal refl exes) as well as from interneurones from other parts of the spinal cord, this means that by the time cortical input reaches motoneurones it has been fi ltered by multiple lower level systems. In higher primates and in man, cortical input can access some motoneurones via a special direct pathway (the corticomotoneuronal pathway), which is often supposed to play a critical role in volitional movement. However, even if this input is strong (and there is little comparative evidence on this) the excitability of motoneurones will have been biased by the multiple other inputs that each one receives. Thus, even this connection does not guarantee the brain a straightforward control of muscle.</p>

This is particularly relevant during reaching with the arm and during the swing phase of gait for the leg. In both cases, the limbs are relatively free from feedback control from gravitational and contact force sensors, and can therefore be driven to a large extent by visual inputs.</p>

All of these areas of cortex also project to brainstem areas that give rise to reticulospinal tracts, giving them an indirect, cortico- reticulo-spinal route to the spinal cord as well as the direct corticospinal route. The primary motor cortex is thought to have fewer of these indirect connections than other motor areas, suggesting that its output represents the most ‘favored’ cortical access to spinal cord circuits.</p>

An obvious exception to this is the monosynaptic connection between primary muscle spindle afferents and their homony-mous motoneurones.

Going from posture to movement means turning off the connections that assure stability and turning on those that allow movement. […] A second advantage of interneurones is that they can specialize in producing different patterns or rhythms of activity. This could be a special property of individual neurones or a property of an interconnected network of neurones, such as envisaged for the locomotor pattern generator.</p>

            <p>Drawing a picture where spinal circuits are autonomous, but modulated, by cortical input.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>t is a general fi nding that every single interneu-rone receives input not only from the sensory modality which is the basis for its classifi cation (e.g. as a ‘Ia inhibitory interneurone’, ‘Ib inhibitory interneurone’, ‘gr. II interneurone’ or ‘fl exor refl ex afferent interneurone’), but also from a number of other sensory afferent modal-ities, other interneurones and a number of descending pathways (e.g. corticospinal, vestibu-lospinal, reticulospinal).</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            <p>It is not an unrealistic possibility that spinal interneurones with a slight turn of events could have been classifi ed based on their supraspinal input as taking part in different voluntary movements rather than the current clas-sifi cation based on afferent input as taking part in different refl ex actions. This was realized already by Sherrington (1906) more than 100 years ago when he wrote: “A simple refl ex is probably a purely abstract conception, because all parts of the nervous system are connected together and no part of it is probably ever capable of reaction without affecting and being affected by various other parts, and it is a system certainly never absolutely at rest. But the simple refl ex is a convenient, if not a probable, fi ction.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            <p><strong>The discharge of every single motoneurone and thus the activation of every single muscle fi ber is determined by the integrated depolarization from on average 10,000 synaptic inputs arising from a number of different sensory modalities, spinal interneu-rones and supraspinal control centres.</strong></p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Cortical input to the spinal cord should be viewed as using or modulating the output of the spinal circuitry itself. There is no separation between ‘spinal refl exes’ and ‘cortical voluntary movement’. Instead, it is important to focus on how the neuronal machinery in the spinal cord may provide an extremely fl exible tool for the execution of voluntary movements.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            <p>We hypothesize that there are at least two advantages of cortical control. The fi rst is adaptability which emerges as a consequence of the anatomy of the cortical motor representation. The second is integration of visual input which is particularly important in shaping the hand to manipulate objects. Individuation and precision are secondary consequences of this organization.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Begs the question of a no-visual experiment?</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>EMG recordings show that very short synchronous bursts of activity are characteristic of many fractionated fi nger movements, such as writing and tool use […] Interposing interneuronal synapses in these connections would tend to remove synchrony and smooth out the command. This is indeed what is seen following corti-cospinal lesion (Farmer et al., 1993). The CM system may thus also be at the heart of human evolution in view of the evolutionary advantage of being able to throw something at an animal in order to kill and eat it.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            <p>One- third of the cortex, particularly in the parietal and premotor areas, is devoted to visual processing. A considerable part of this is used for shaping/orienting our hand in preparation for grasping and manipulating objects</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            <p>the motor cortex may differ from the spinal cord in degree of fl exibility and a larger possibility of integrating visual input, but otherwise there are no differences between the motor cortex and the spinal cord circuitries (after all CM cells project to motoneurones and receive sensory input much like any good old- fashioned interneurone) that could warrant a signifi cantly different role in our conscious experience of control of the movements that we perform. What we are proposing is that it is not the degree of perceived volition which determines to what extent the motor cortex is involved in a given task, but rather the need for fl exible visual control.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            <p>We hope that we have made it clear that there is little to support this distinction between automatic and voluntary tasks. We need to consider the integration between supraspinal and spinal control centers for any specifi c task in order to understand how that task is controlled by the nervous system, and try to avoid putting into it volition and voluntary which in any case are terms that belong in philosophy or in specifi c inquiries aimed at unravelling the mechanisms of our cognitive abilities and our conscious experiences.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Compelling case to look at the entirety of the system, focusing on the contributions that cause motor neurons to fire.</p>
            <!-- Motor systems are another area of AI where biologically inspired solutions may be helpful. Compare the fluid flow of animal movements to the rigid motions of most robots. The key difference is the exceptional flexibility exhibited in the control of high-dimensional musculature in all animals. Coordinated behavior in high-dimensional motor planning spaces is an active area of investigation in deep learning networks (29). There is also a need for a theory of distributed control to explain how the multiple layers of control in the spinal cord, brainstem, and forebrain are coordinated. Both brains and control systems have to deal with time delays in feedback loops, which can become unstable. The forward model of the body in the cerebellum provides a way to predict the sensory outcome of a motor command, and the sensory prediction errors are used to optimize open-loop control.
