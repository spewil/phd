            <p>Hans Moravec’s eponymous paradox states that it is easier to generate artificially intelligent performance on tasks we think of as intellectually challenging, such as chess, than to provide a machine with faculties we take for granted, such as movement. For example, Moravec’s Paradox encourages us to not look past the stunningly complex computations generated by the human motor apparatus. Following Moravec’s suggestion, this work focuses on the human motor system, the most advanced control apparatus in the known universe.</p>
            <p>A recent review corroborates this perspective and provides a clear call to action:</p>
            <blockquote>

            </blockquote>
            <p>Over the last few decades, there has been considerable amount of work done to untangle the abilities of the motor system to flexibly control the body including through optimal control theory<span class="citation" data-cites="Todorov2004"><sup><a href="#ref-Todorov2004" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></sup></span>, reinforcement learning in continuous action space<span class="citation" data-cites="koberReinforcementLearningRobotics2013"><sup><a href="#ref-koberReinforcementLearningRobotics2013" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></sup></span>, and detailed physiological studies<span class="citation" data-cites="sauerbreiCorticalPatternGeneration2019"><sup><a href="#ref-sauerbreiCorticalPatternGeneration2019" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></sup></span>. However, as the quote above suggests, a holistic understanding of the computations underlying the generation of skilled movement remains an open problem. The aim of this thesis is to progress our understanding of skilled movement by studying the solutions produced by human subjects to motor tasks in dynamically rich, yet controlled, virtual environments. Our goal is to reverse-engineer the ability to acquire and perform novel motor skills. First we define what we mean by the terms <em>skill</em>, and <em>task</em>.</p>
            <!-- humans have extraordinary motoric ability, we want to understand why -->
            <!-- Robustness, Flexibility, Generalization, Composition -->
            <!-- Why is this the most interesting problem?  -->
            <!-- The interesting problem here is coordination of a redundant system to produce dexterous solutions-- we want to solve the redundancy problem and produce solutions that are robust to external perturbations and sensitive to new information -->
            <p>Humans produce a great variety of movements every day, often without conscious thought. For example, movements like bringing a cup of coffee to our lips for a sip are generally out of reach for state-of-the-art robotic systems. We claim that this “motor gap” between biological and artificial motor systems is due to a lack of <em>dexterity</em> in the latter. Soviet neuroscientist Nikolai Bernstein defined dexterity as the ability to “find a motor solution in any situation and in any condition.”<span class="citation" data-cites="Bernstein1967"><sup><a href="#ref-Bernstein1967" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span> The crux of this definition is the flexibility of such solutions. This flexibility, or robustness<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a><span class="citation" data-cites="kitanoBiologicalRobustness2004"><sup><a href="#ref-kitanoBiologicalRobustness2004" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></sup></span>, is the ability to optimize internal parameters in response to external perturbations and adapt to new information to achieve the goals of an ongoing plan.</p>
            <p>While a robot may be able to move a cup of coffee to a precise location in space, its solution is often found to be brittle in a new context, or unable to generalize to the movement of new objects. We define a skill as a behavior that involves dexterity in Bernstein’s sense. The use of a tool such as a screwdriver is an example of a motor skill. We define a task as the production of skilled movement in a particular context. Driving a screw in a particular posture using a particular screwdriver is an example of a task. These concepts will be further formalized in later chapters.</p>
            <!-- Physiology is special for human hands so we chose them as a testbed -->
            <p>Human movement is ultimately the result of the activation and contraction of muscle fibers, and movements lie on a spectrum between reflexive and volitional. The supramuscular circuitry which determines the degree of volition we ascribe to movement, where volitional movement relies on supraspinal (though not necessarily conscious) processes. The human hand is a unique evolutionary invention that underlies our ability to perform various skills in a range of tasks– movements that are decidedly volitional<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. The hand is the pinnacle of dexterity and, as such, it is a fruitful testbed for studying the computations and circuitry that drive dexterous movement. A detailed physiological review of the hand and it’s relation to skilled movement is described in Section <a href="#sec:physiology">2</a>.</p>
            <!-- Setting up a specific experiment will help us to track muscle-level changes -->
            <p>We are more interested in the leveraging the hand as a readout of flexible motor behavior than we are in the kinematics of hand movement itself. For this reason, we chose to develop an experimental setup that is capable of recording directly from muscle activations. We achieve this through surface electromyography recordings taken from the forearms controlling subjects’ dominant hands. This allows us to track the sequential selection of muscle these contractions during skill acquisition and subsequent goal-oriented muscle activations. As we are interested in subjects’ abilities to acquire new skills, we design tasks that require subjects to use available, but uncommon, motor activations. We then track the selection and execution of these activation during virtual tasks. The details of how this is achieved are described in Section <a href="#sec:experiment">3</a>.</p>
            <!-- we think theorizing with control and learning models will help us -->
            <!-- what exactly from the theory world will help us? why is control/RL relevant? -->
            <!-- what are we missing in the neuro / behavior lit that we need to borrow? -->
            <!-- BE MORE SPECIFIC HERE -->
            <!-- Admit that we need to collect and analyze data in an exploratory manner to then inspire hypotheses that can be modeled. We want these hypotheses to be inspired by theoretical work in control and learning theory -->
            <p>how are value computations connected to action and policy selection how are feedback controllers adapted to motor errors, new environments, how are they learned as well as combined?</p>
            <p>Using data from our experimental setup, we hope to gain an understanding of how the structure of muscle activation variability in evolves during skill acquisition and how the motor system constructs skilled movement through the composition of component muscle coactivations. We believe that to make progress on these two lines of enquiry we should work to reconcile the language of the experimental sensorimotor control and learning community with the language of the control theory and reinforcement learning community, as each of these communities shares a common goal of understanding the computation underlying the production of skilled movement. Here we develop several models in this direction, as described in Section <a href="#sec:theory">5</a>.</p>

            <p>As we hope to make progress engineering naturalistic artificial movement, it will be beneficial to review what is known about the biological movement system. Beginning with the architecture of the motor system and it’s relation to dexterity will provide a scaffold on which we can hang our experimental and theoretical investigations detailed in Section <a href="#sec:experiment">3</a> and Section <a href="#sec:theory">5</a>. Specifically, we can use results from prior physiological investigations to ground our perspective on the computations relevant to skilled hand movements. We find that the dexterous solutions produced by the human motor system rely on a incredibly complex architecture, but one in which a spectrum of modularity and redundancy appear to be organizing principles.</p>
            <h2 data-number="2.1" id="motor-units-to-muscles"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Motor Units to Muscles</h2>
            <!-- motor units to muscles, a spectrum of redundancy -->
            <!-- build a picture of the staggering complexity of the hand's neuromuscular control structure -->
            <p>Muscles are composed of fibers which contract due to chemical gradients produced at the neuromuscular junction by action potentials emanating from alpha-motoneurons (AMN) in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. The quantum of motor output is the motor unit (MU), which is defined as a single motoneuron axon and the set of junctions its axon branches form with one or more muscle fibers. The innervation ratio of a particular muscle unit is the number of junctions it innervates. In muscles of the arm, the number of MUs and their innervation ratios each range from tens to hundreds per muscle and per motor unit, respectively, decreasing as muscles become more distal.</p>
            <p>The MU thus provides the motor system with spatial redundancy at the muscle level: multiple muscle fibers contract due to a single AMN spike, and multiple AMNs may overlap in their innervations. The forces produced by motor units span several orders of magnitude, though most units produce very small forces. Here we find temporal redundancy: in order to produce movements, MUs combine to generate a range of forces<span class="citation" data-cites="fuglevandMechanicalPropertiesNeural2011"><sup><a href="#ref-fuglevandMechanicalPropertiesNeural2011" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></sup></span>.</p>
            <p>Since the innervation ratios of muscles in the forearm and hand are relatively small compared to more proximal muscles (which contain thousands of MUs), the logarithmic recruitment and redundancy of motor units enables the hand to produce movements with very fine spatiotemporal resolution. Paradoxically, however, the well-known signal-dependent noise in models of motor output has been found to be higher for hand muscles than for more proximal muscles, likely due to small numbers of motor units compare to larger muscles<span class="citation" data-cites="harrisSignaldependentNoiseDetermines1998 fuglevandMechanicalPropertiesNeural2011"><sup><a href="#ref-fuglevandMechanicalPropertiesNeural2011" role="doc-biblioref">7</a>,<a href="#ref-harrisSignaldependentNoiseDetermines1998" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></sup></span>.</p>
            <p>Muscle fibers are contained within muscle compartments, and each muscle may have one or more compartments. The fingers of the hand are extended by the extensor digitorum (ED) which contains four compartments, one for each of the tendons the muscle produces. Each tendon connects to the three metaphalangeal joints of each digit. The fingers are flexed by two muscles, the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP). Like the ED, these muscles produce four tendons, one to each finger from each of their four compartments. As such, one must coactivate these agonist and antagonist muscles in order to extend or flex a single finger in isolation<span class="citation" data-cites="fuglevandMechanicalPropertiesNeural2011"><sup><a href="#ref-fuglevandMechanicalPropertiesNeural2011" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></sup></span>. Adduction and Abduction of the fingers is produced by the 19 instrinsic muscles of the hand, each of which has their origin and insertion points within the hand itself<span class="citation" data-cites="vanduinenConstraintsControlHuman2011"><sup><a href="#ref-vanduinenConstraintsControlHuman2011" role="doc-biblioref">9</a></sup></span>. The instrinisc muscle tendons form a kind of network around each of the digits.</p>
            <p>The human hand, thumb, and forearm system contains more than 30 muscles and at least 20 degrees of freedom are theoretically available for actuation. However, due to biomechanical coupling, the effective degrees of freedom is presumably less than 20. One study found that tendons of the fingers are arranged in such a way as to perform a kind of anatomical computation which expands the mechanical capabilities of the appendage by sharing force across its tendon network<span class="citation" data-cites="Valero-Cuevas2007"><sup><a href="#ref-Valero-Cuevas2007" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></sup></span>. Such computations embedded in the musculoskeletal structure are additional complexity when theorizing about neural control of the hand.</p>
            <p>We believe this structure exists in order to facilitate the acquisition of new skills and the generalization of existing skills to new contexts. While the anatomy of the hand and forearm presents constraints on movement, the system remains capable of producing a incredible variety of movement patterns<span class="citation" data-cites="yanUnexpectedComplexityEveryday2020 Basmajian1963"><sup><a href="#ref-yanUnexpectedComplexityEveryday2020" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>,<a href="#ref-Basmajian1963" role="doc-biblioref">12</a></sup></span><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. The structure of the neuromuscular system that underlies this variety offers many clues as to the relevant computations required for dexterous movement.</p>
            <!-- 

            These redundancies at the neurophysiological level play a role in "spillover", where contractions of one muscle or muscle compartment seem to spill over into neighboring muscles and muscle compartments. This is evident in the difficulty of moving single fingers individually. As mentioned previously, this may be a hardwired constraint or a byproduct of plasticity induced by behavioral requirements. 

            > Spillover has been shown in experiments studying the ‘recruitment thresholds’ (defined below) of motor units ac ting on other digits during single digit contractions (Kilbreath & Gandevia, 1994; Butler et al. 2005; van Duinen et al. 2009). In these experiments, motor units were recorded from one (test) compartment of the respective muscles, while subjects were asked to contract the compartment of the other digits up to 50% of their maximal force. When the subjects contracted these other digits (one by one), motor units of the test compartment were often recruited. The amount of force produced by the other digits at the time of recruitment of the motor unit of the test compartment is termed the recruitment threshold. The general finding for all three muscles was that, the closer the contracting compartment to the test finger, the more motor units were recruited. [...] One has to ask whether this spillover is functional. Is the frequent recruitment of motor units ac ting on the little finger when we extend the thumb part of a fixed pattern of muscle activation, perhaps to balance forces around the wrist? (Duinen & Gandevia 2011)

            <!-- 
            http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Motor_coordination

            Coordination between two or more effectors (muscles, joints, limbs, or even different people) occurs when the motor commands to one effector depend (in a causal or statistical sense) on the state of the other effector(s). Coordination is goal-directed; the interdependency of movements promotes the achievement of a behavioral task. 

            The term “synergy” is often introduced to explain coordination across different muscles. As a descriptive term, a synergy simply refers to the strong regularities in the spatiotemporal pattern of muscle commands, and the observation that large portions of the variance of recorded muscle activity can be described by a small number of linear components (d'Avella et al. 2006). As an explanatory term, a synergy refers to a neural controller that produces the correlated pattern of muscle activity. 

            In the framework of Optimal Feedback Control, coordination in both feed-forward and feedback control is achieved by making the control policy of one effector dependent on an internal estimate of the state of another effector (Todorov et al. 2002, Diedrichsen et al. 2010). The difference between feed-forward or feedback control within this framework is gradual, and simply reflects the fact that the state estimate is informed by an internal prediction in the former, and actual sensory information in the latter case.

            <p>Nikolai Bernstein coined the phrase “the degrees-of-freedom problem” to describe the challenge the motor system faces in coordinating its many dimension to achieve a goal. Solving this problem requires dexterity.<span class="citation" data-cites="Bernstein1967"><sup><a href="#ref-Bernstein1967" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span> As we have seen, redundancy is present from joints and muscles to motor units and their upstream synaptic partners. However, rather than asking how the motor control system deals with this “problem” overwhelming complexity, we might instead question why this complexity is evolutionarily advantageous at all. What does the availability of this redundancy afford the motor system? How does this redundancy enable dexterous movement?</p>
            <p>A considerable amount of discussion has focused on the existence of synergies as a simplifying structure which allows the motor system to “solve” the redundancy “problem”. The term motor synergy can be used descriptively to describe the spatiotemporal coactivation of muscles necessary for an ongoing task. Synergetic control implies control in the space of a low-dimensional set of synergy weights rather than independent control over the actuator dimensions themselves. The control dimensions are functionally coupled as a result of synergetic action, which both simplifies the control task and constrains behavior to the low-dimensional subspace defined by the synergy weights<span class="citation" data-cites="merelHierarchicalMotorControl2019"><sup><a href="#ref-merelHierarchicalMotorControl2019" role="doc-biblioref">13</a></sup></span>. This is what Bizzi and colleagues refer to as “the puppet’s strings”. The term can also be used as a normative model of motor coordination which implies a constraint in the dimensionality of the descending supraspinal control signal, the simplifying movements of the puppeteer.</p>
            <p>Many studies have contributed to the concept of synergies as a hard-wired organizing feature of the motor system<span class="citation" data-cites="mussa-ivaldiMotorLearningCombination2000"><sup><a href="#ref-DAvella2003" role="doc-biblioref">14</a></sup></span>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> However, these works tend to extrapolate from non-primate preparations, particularly in the frog, and use tasks which are inherently low-dimensional to explain covariance structure in primate and human kinematic and electromyography data<span class="citation" data-cites="giszterMotorPrimitivesNew2015 Gao2017"><sup><a href="#ref-giszterMotorPrimitivesNew2015" role="doc-biblioref">15</a>,<a href="#ref-Gao2017" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>Gao2017?</strong></a></sup></span>. That said, it would be foolish to deny the existence of synergistic muscle coactivation even at the structural level.

This has primarily been taken to be the number of linear features which contain a desired level of the original signal variance, where the signal is the joint angles of the hand engaged in various behaviors<span class="citation" data-cites="Ingram2009 TodorovDimensionality2005"><sup><a href="#ref-Ingram2009" role="doc-biblioref">17</a>,<a href="#ref-TodorovDimensionality2005" role="doc-biblioref">18</a></sup></span>. These methods have resulted in roughly 8 linear features of hand kinematics to solve a variety of tasks, with subtleties found in inter-task and inter-subject variations.^[It has been argued that the motor repertoire is hardly high-dimensional when compared to the dimensionality of the visual feature extraction system<span class="citation" data-cites="yanUnexpectedComplexityEveryday2020"><sup><a href="#ref-yanUnexpectedComplexityEveryday2020" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></sup></span>. A recent study found that low-variance linear, kinematic components displayed significantly higher correlation within condition (e.g. grasp of a specific object) than across condition. This suggests that these components carry task-dependent information rather than condition-independent, task-irrelevant noise<span class="citation" data-cites="yanUnexpectedComplexityEveryday2020"><sup><a href="#ref-yanUnexpectedComplexityEveryday2020" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></sup></span>. This suggests that the control of the hand is more nuanced than a set of fixed synergies.</p>
            <p>What Bizzi and colleagues call “the problem of supraspinal pattern formation”–how synergies are activated through time– we argue, in the context of hand control, is not simplified by the existence of hard-wired or soft-wired synergies<span class="citation" data-cites="bizziMotorPlanningExecution2020"><sup><a href="#ref-bizziMotorPlanningExecution2020" role="doc-biblioref">19</a></sup></span>. The CNS produces control signals in a range of contexts and in response to continually changing task demands. Rather than the CNS “simplifying movement” through synergetic action, it is more likely that hand synergies fall out of a optimization strategy which trades off effort and accuracy where effort may, in part, correspond to independent control of individual control dimensions. If we limit ourselves to synergetic control, then we have simply passed the problem to a lower-dimensional one of the same fundamental nature. Neural control of the hand likely contains a spectrum of modularity in order to maintain its role as a flexible instrument. Synergetic action is one end of this spectrum resulting from the computation and structure of the human movement machine.</p>

            <!-- with CM connections, how synergies might they not be as rigid as we think when we're talking about the hand -->
            <p>At the other end of the spectrum, years of research has contributed to a more complex picture of hand function which embraces non-synergistic movement<span class="citation" data-cites="lemon1993 lemon1997 lemon2008"><sup><a href="#ref-lemon1993" role="doc-biblioref">20</a>–<a href="#ref-lemon2008" role="doc-biblioref">22</a></sup></span>. The key insight of the work is that while “the organization of the spinal cord is based on relatively rigid muscular modes, a mechanism to fractionate this is of particular importance for the muscles of the hands and digits which may need to be employed in a variety of flexible associations during voluntary movements.” Careful anatomical work has shown how monosynaptic corticospinal, or corticomotoneuronal (CM), connections provide such fractionation in primates which use tools requiring dexterity<span class="citation" data-cites="lemonStartingStoppingMovement2019"><sup><a href="#ref-lemonStartingStoppingMovement2019" role="doc-biblioref">23</a></sup></span>. M connections are specific to the primate corticospinal tract and specific to distal muscles of the hands and arm. It appears that the rodent CST contains CM connections until they recede around P10 at which point they recede<span class="citation" data-cites="kawasawa2017 murabe2018"><sup><a href="#ref-kawasawa2017" role="doc-biblioref">24</a>,<a href="#ref-murabe2018" role="doc-biblioref">25</a></sup></span>.</p>
            <p>Just as many muscle fibers may be innervated by a single AMN, up to thousands of neurons contact single AMNs through CM connections or a variety of spinal interneuron circuits. The hallmark of CM connections is their influence over multiple muscle compartments as well as multiple muscles, though typically agonist or antagonist sets<span class="citation" data-cites="cheneyFunctionalClassesPrimate1980"><sup><a href="#ref-cheneyFunctionalClassesPrimate1980" role="doc-biblioref">26</a></sup></span>. This may seem counter-intuitive as a means to produce individuated movement, but experimental evidence in primates has show that the convergence of many CM collateral fibers onto single AMNs driving the distal muscles in particular can produce a fine grading of activity over motor units driving the distal joints. CM cells also appear to play a role in the inhibition of antagonist muscles prior to contractions required for movement.<span class="citation" data-cites="griffinMotorCortexUses2020"><sup><a href="#ref-griffinMotorCortexUses2020" role="doc-biblioref">27</a></sup></span> These findings confirm theories about the excitatory and inhibitory role of these connection dating back decades, and combine to suggest that variables encoded in cortical ensembles are more complex than kinematics or dynamics alone.<span class="citation" data-cites="cheneyFunctionalClassesPrimate1980"><sup><a href="#ref-cheneyFunctionalClassesPrimate1980" role="doc-biblioref">26</a></sup></span>.</p>
            <p>The CM tract thus acts in coordination with synergistic muscle activations of the hand to achieve control that is balanced between modularity and flexibility. Findings suggest that there is a bipartite structure in human motor cortex driving dexterous control of the distal part of the upper limb which, it has been suggested, evolved under pressure to quickly generalize between tasks. This work argues that these two streams of hand control, namely “fractionated” and “synergistic” control, may interact to produce versatility, and balancing these subsystems may be a key part of the optimization function when learning new skills<span class="citation" data-cites="Rathelot2009 griffinCorticomotoneuronalCellsAre2015 Takei2017"><sup><a href="#ref-Rathelot2009" role="doc-biblioref">28</a>–<a href="#ref-Takei2017" role="doc-biblioref">30</a></sup></span>. This dualism is likely not rigidly dichotomous, but rather a spectrum of overriding fractionation (so-called “New M1”) atop a phylogenetically older system of synergistic action<span class="citation" data-cites="dumCorticospinalSystemStructural2011"><sup><a href="#ref-dumCorticospinalSystemStructural2011" role="doc-biblioref">31</a></sup></span>. Griffin and colleagues found that CM cells are functionally tuned to a muscle’s mode of activity (agonist, antagonist, fixator) to “bypass spinal cord mechanisms and sculpt novel patterns of motor output that are essential for highly skilled movements”.<span class="citation" data-cites="griffinCorticomotoneuronalCellsAre2015"><sup><a href="#ref-griffinCorticomotoneuronalCellsAre2015" role="doc-biblioref">29</a></sup></span></p>
            <!-- Individual corticomotoneurons contact multiple motor pools, and rarely (if ever) individual motor neurons. -->
            <!-- > It is generally believed that the direct corticomotoneuronal (CM) pathway, which is a phylogenetically newer pathway in higher primates, plays a critical role in the fractionation of muscle activity during dexterous hand movements. However, the present study demonstrated that PreM-INs, which are phylogenetically older, have spatiotemporal properties that correlate with muscle synergies during voluntary hand movements. Therefore, it is likely that these two systems have specialized functions for the control of primate hand movements, namely “fractionated control” and “synergistic control,” respectively. The interaction of these two putative control systems might be the source of the exceptional versatility of primate hand movements. [...] Optimization of balanced control may be an important factor also for the acquisition of new motor skills [@Takei2017]. -->
            <p>The degree to which fractionation of movement is learned is unknown. Skilled piano performers have been found to exhibit a higher degree of independent movement among the fingers compared to control participants. Control groups displayed a hierarchical, presumably lower dimensional, organization of finger movement patterns while pianists showed distinct but individuated movement patterns<span class="citation" data-cites="furuyaFlexibilityMovementOrganization2013"><sup><a href="#ref-furuyaFlexibilityMovementOrganization2013" role="doc-biblioref">32</a></sup></span>. These results are imply that with skilled practice humans can produce finer and more independent movements of the fingers, and construct bespoke coactivations to solve specific goals. Similarly, studies have found that coherence between the index finger and thumb is greater on the dominant hand. This might imply a developmental lateralization, but use-dependent plasticity due to greater precision grip behavior of the dominant hand is also a viable explanation<span class="citation" data-cites="fuglevandMechanicalPropertiesNeural2011"><sup><a href="#ref-fuglevandMechanicalPropertiesNeural2011" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></sup></span>.</p>
            <p>The concept of a balanced control may prove to be a fruitful direction for theoretical work on dexterous motor control, the goal being to construct a model which takes into account this spectrum of individuation into account. The experimental challenge is to identify tasks which ostensibly require the direct descending connections to fractionate learned synergies. There is work suggesting that CM connections synapse primarily on low threshold, low force motor units that are recruited first. This would imply a difference in synergy fractionation at lower force as opposed to higher force. This can be tested easily by including a force parameter in a hand control task. The hypothesis stemming from the previously described work is that CM connections override the “consolidated” patterns putatively generated via spinal interneuron circuitry.</p>

            <p>It is known from recent work that primary motor cortex (M1) is not an isolated movement-generating dynamical system, but rather a node in the network of a feedback-modulated, distributed movement machine. This is reflected in recent work in the rodent which suggests that task-relevant movement depends on these network connections.<span class="citation" data-cites="sauerbreiCorticalPatternGeneration2019"><sup><a href="#ref-sauerbreiCorticalPatternGeneration2019" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></sup></span> This finding is relevant for our purposed as it demonstrates a fundamental function for cortical input as opposed to a specific substructure of motor cortex as detailed above in the primate literature.</p>
            <p>Thinking structural architecture of M1 as an input-driven system with outputs along a spectrum of modularity from synergistic to fractionated, we can then ask what kind of functional architecture might have evolved in the neuromuscular controller? Graziano and colleagues found that 500ms electrical stimulation to M1 reliabaly produced stereotyped movements in primates.<span class="citation" data-cites="grazianoORGANIZATIONBEHAVIORALREPERTOIRE2006"><sup><a href="#ref-grazianoORGANIZATIONBEHAVIORALREPERTOIRE2006" role="doc-biblioref">33</a></sup></span> These movements appeared to produce goal-oriented actions pulled out of other contexts such as bringing food to the mouth, and seemed to be arranged on the cortical sheet topographically in terms of spatial endpoints rather than as a homonculus. Graziano refers to this as the cortical “action map”, that these stimulations tapped into the control mechanisms of the primate’s motor system<span class="citation" data-cites="grazianoIntelligentMovementMachine2009"><sup><a href="#ref-grazianoIntelligentMovementMachine2009" role="doc-biblioref">34</a></sup></span>.</p>
            <p>Recent work identifying movement syllables on a behaviorally relevant timescale has a similar flavor. Along with behavioral syllables, the motor map concept posits the idea that M1 might be looked at like a field of feedback control microcircuits, integrating and transforming inputs, both internal and external, to sculpt ongoing movement.<span class="citation" data-cites="wiltschkoMappingSubSecondStructure2015"><sup><a href="#ref-wiltschkoMappingSubSecondStructure2015" role="doc-biblioref">35</a></sup></span> This is in accordance with the idea that there is a structural hierarchy in M1 covering a spectrum of movement modularity. These ideas together form a picture of the motor system as a structural scaffold upon which behaviorally relevant feedback mappings from cortex to the spinal cord are continuously activated and modulated based on information and estimates about the periphery. In this view, the encoded variables of interest depend on the goals, context, and perturbations of the intended movement. Graziano writes:</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>“The usefulness of a feedback-dependent mapping from cortex to muscles is that it can in principle allow neurons in motor cortex to control a diversity of movement variables, such as direction, speed, hand position, or posture that transcend a fixed pattern of muscle activation. If the network receives feedback information about a specific movement variable, then it can learn to control that variable.”</p>

            <p>Muscle activity is, in a sense, a readout from a network transforming state-dependent inputs into movement goals. Rather than playing chords, the motor system is improvisational jazzmaster. The movement machine wields its complexity to construct a movement fit to purpose, to suit its context and the information it receives. Rather than choosing muscle patterns in reconfigurable blocks, it creatively constructs and sculpts movements. That is, the hierarchy of the motor system is not rigidly organized around a particular set of variables. Many loops exist connecting cortex with the spinal cord, the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, and the sensorimotor periphery. Each of these loops contributes information to flexible activate the relevant action maps. Prevailing theory suggests that cerebellar loops provide predictive state information while basal gangliar loops provide state and/or action value information.</p>
            <p>The movement machine reasons in the space of feedback control systems and their ensuing trajectories. The phenomenal thing about the motor system is that it is able to tune itself rapidly with both high-dimensional sensory inputs and sparse reward signals<span class="citation" data-cites="bahlNeuralDynamicPoliciesfor2020 ijspeertDynamicalMovementPrimitives2013"><sup><a href="#ref-bahlNeuralDynamicPoliciesfor2020" role="doc-biblioref">36</a>,<a href="#ref-ijspeertDynamicalMovementPrimitives2013" role="doc-biblioref">37</a></sup></span>. This has some precedence in the literature and will be discussed further in Section <a href="#sec:theory">5</a>. This section has attempted to illustrate the complexity of the motor control system specifically with regard to dexterous control of the hand, with an eye toward experimental and theoretical avenues for exploration. The goal is to build and test a theoretical scheme for aspects of the compositional nature of the neural hand controller.</p>

The effect of the network is to create a specific class of mapping from the cortex to the muscles, a mapping that can change continuously on the basis of feedback about the state of the periphery. If the periphery is relatively still, the mapping from cortex to muscles appears fixed and resembles the traditional view. But once the state of the periphery is allowed to vary as in natural movement, the mapping from cortex to muscles becomes somewhat fluid in a manner that facilitates complex movement control.** [@grazianoIntelligentMovementMachine2009] -->

The control of other body parts, such as the upper arm, involves mainly projections from the motor cortex to spinal interneurons.** -->

            ### Muscle Spindles

            Arm  movements  are  sensed  via  distributed  and  individually  ambiguous  activity  patterns  of  muscle  spindles,which depend on relative joint configurations rather than the absolute hand position.  Interpreting this high dimensional  input  (around  50  muscles  for  a  human  arm)  of  distributed information at the relevant behavioral level poses a challenging  decoding  problem  for  the  central  nervous  system. Proprioceptive information from the receptors undergoes several  processing  steps  before  reaching  somatosensory  cortex (3,8) - from the spindles that synapse in Clarke’s nucleus, to cuneate nucleus, thalamus (3,9), and finally to somatosensory cortex (S1).   In cortex,  a number of tuning properties have been observed, such as responsiveness to varied combinations of joints and muscle lengths (10,11), sensitivity to different loads and angles (12), and broad and unimodal tuning for movement direction during arm movements (11,13).The proprioceptive information in S1 is then hypothesized to serve as the basis of a wide variety of tasks, via its connections to motor cortex and higher somatosensory processing regions.
