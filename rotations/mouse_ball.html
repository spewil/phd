<p>I used a Logitech trackball mouse to set up a mouse motor task. I realized in the end that I would be better served in my efforts to use human data to test my hypotheses, but I think experiments like the one I intended to set up are very important in understanding dexterous motor control. It would take some time for mice to learn this task, but I think it would be well worth it. Home cage training would almost be essential.</p>
