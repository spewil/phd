## Ctrl-Labs Rotation 

The goal of this rotation was to understand how EMG can be used to study human motor control and learning. Ctrl-Labs is the most advanced electromyography research group in the world hands-down, and it was crucial to my PhD project to learn from the team there. I worked on thinking about single-muscle-spike control, an effort to overturn dogma about motor unit recruitment. I designed a consumer-facing application for training muscle spikes from a naive user.
