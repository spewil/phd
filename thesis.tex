\emph{Movement is nothing but the quality of our being.}

--- Sunryu Suzuki, \emph{Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind}
\end{quote}

Hans Moravec's eponymous paradox states that it is easier to generate
artificially intelligent performance on tasks we think of as
intellectually challenging, such as chess, than to provide a machine
with faculties we take for granted, such as movement. For example,
Moravec's Paradox encourages us to not look past the stunningly complex
computations generated by the human motor apparatus. Following Moravec's
suggestion, this work focuses on the human motor system, the most
advanced control apparatus in the known universe.

A recent review corroborates this perspective and provides a clear call
to action:

\begin{quote}
The processes by which biological control solutions spanning large and
continuous state spaces are constructed remain relatively unexplored.
Future investigations may need to embed rich dynamical interactions
between object dynamics and task goals in novel and complex
movements.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-McNamee2019}{1}}
\end{quote}

Over the last few decades, there has been considerable amount of work
done to untangle the abilities of the motor system to flexibly control
the body including through optimal control
theory\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-Todorov2004}{2}},
reinforcement learning in continuous action
space\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-koberReinforcementLearningRobotics2013}{3}},
and detailed physiological
studies\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-sauerbreiCorticalPatternGeneration2019}{4}}.
However, as the quote above suggests, a holistic understanding of the
computations underlying the generation of skilled movement remains an
open problem. The aim of this thesis is to progress our understanding of
skilled movement by studying the solutions produced by human subjects to
motor tasks in dynamically rich, yet controlled, virtual environments.
Our goal is to reverse-engineer the ability to acquire and perform novel
motor skills. First we define what we mean by the terms \emph{skill},
and \emph{task}.

Humans produce a great variety of movements every day, often without
conscious thought. For example, movements like bringing a cup of coffee
to our lips for a sip are generally out of reach for state-of-the-art
robotic systems. We claim that this ``motor gap'' between biological and
artificial motor systems is due to a lack of \emph{dexterity} in the
latter. Soviet neuroscientist Nikolai Bernstein defined dexterity as the
ability to ``find a motor solution in any situation and in any
condition.''\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bernstein1967}{5}}
The crux of this definition is the flexibility of such solutions. This
flexibility, or
robustness\footnote{Kitano defines robustness as ``the maintenance of
  specific functionalities of the system against perturbations, and it
  often requires the system to change its mode of operation in a
  flexible way.'' He claims that robustness requires control,
  alternative mechanisms, modularity and decoupling between high and low
  level variability.}\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-kitanoBiologicalRobustness2004}{6}},
is the ability to optimize internal parameters in response to external
perturbations and adapt to new information to achieve the goals of an
ongoing plan.

While a robot may be able to move a cup of coffee to a precise location
in space, its solution is often found to be brittle in a new context, or
unable to generalize to the movement of new objects. We define a skill
as a behavior that involves dexterity in Bernstein's sense. The use of a
tool such as a screwdriver is an example of a motor skill. We define a
task as the production of skilled movement in a particular context.
Driving a screw in a particular posture using a particular screwdriver
is an example of a task. These concepts will be further formalized in
later chapters.

Human movement is ultimately the result of the activation and
contraction of muscle fibers, and movements lie on a spectrum between
reflexive and volitional. The supramuscular circuitry which determines
the degree of volition we ascribe to movement, where volitional movement
relies on supraspinal (though not necessarily conscious) processes. The
human hand is a unique evolutionary invention that underlies our ability
to perform various skills in a range of tasks-- movements that are
decidedly volitional\footnote{It could be argued that the hand is in
  fact a crucial aspect of humanness. It is thought that the human
  cerebellar and neocortices evolved reciprocally to expand and support
  the computational burden of increasingly complex motor tasks such as
  tool-making and language production. REF?}. The hand is the pinnacle
of dexterity and, as such, it is a fruitful testbed for studying the
computations and circuitry that drive dexterous movement. A detailed
physiological review of the hand and it's relation to skilled movement
is described in \cref{sec:physiology}.

We are more interested in the leveraging the hand as a readout of
flexible motor behavior than we are in the kinematics of hand movement
itself. For this reason, we chose to develop an experimental setup that
is capable of recording directly from muscle activations. We achieve
this through surface electromyography recordings taken from the forearms
controlling subjects' dominant hands. This allows us to track the
sequential selection of muscle these contractions during skill
acquisition and subsequent goal-oriented muscle activations. As we are
interested in subjects' abilities to acquire new skills, we design tasks
that require subjects to use available, but uncommon, motor activations.
We then track the selection and execution of these activation during
virtual tasks. The details of how this is achieved are described in
\cref{sec:experiment}.

how are value computations connected to action and policy selection how
are feedback controllers adapted to motor errors, new environments, how
are they learned as well as combined?

Using data from our experimental setup, we hope to gain an understanding
of how the structure of muscle activation variability in evolves during
skill acquisition and how the motor system constructs skilled movement
through the composition of component muscle coactivations. We believe
that to make progress on these two lines of enquiry we should work to
reconcile the language of the experimental sensorimotor control and
learning community with the language of the control theory and
reinforcement learning community, as each of these communities shares a
common goal of understanding the computation underlying the production
of skilled movement. Here we develop several models in this direction,
as described in \cref{sec:theory}.

\emph{Even a simple movement is a global body event.}

--- Bizzi \& Ajemian, \emph{2020}
\end{quote}

As we hope to make progress engineering naturalistic artificial
movement, it will be beneficial to review what is known about the
biological movement system. Beginning with the architecture of the motor
system and it's relation to dexterity will provide a scaffold on which
we can hang our experimental and theoretical investigations detailed in
\cref{sec:experiment} and \cref{sec:theory}. Specifically, we can use
results from prior physiological investigations to ground our
perspective on the computations relevant to skilled hand movements. We
find that the dexterous solutions produced by the human motor system
rely on a incredibly complex architecture, but one in which a spectrum
of modularity and redundancy appear to be organizing principles.

\hypertarget{motor-units-to-muscles}{%
\subsection{Motor Units to Muscles}\label{motor-units-to-muscles}}

Muscles are composed of fibers which contract due to chemical gradients
produced at the neuromuscular junction by action potentials emanating
from alpha-motoneurons (AMN) in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. The
quantum of motor output is the motor unit (MU), which is defined as a
single motoneuron axon and the set of junctions its axon branches form
with one or more muscle fibers. The innervation ratio of a particular
muscle unit is the number of junctions it innervates. In muscles of the
arm, the number of MUs and their innervation ratios each range from tens
to hundreds per muscle and per motor unit, respectively, decreasing as
muscles become more distal.

The MU thus provides the motor system with spatial redundancy at the
muscle level: multiple muscle fibers contract due to a single AMN spike,
and multiple AMNs may overlap in their innervations. The forces produced
by motor units span several orders of magnitude, though most units
produce very small forces. Here we find temporal redundancy: in order to
produce movements, MUs combine to generate a range of
forces\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-fuglevandMechanicalPropertiesNeural2011}{7}}.

Since the innervation ratios of muscles in the forearm and hand are
relatively small compared to more proximal muscles (which contain
thousands of MUs), the logarithmic recruitment and redundancy of motor
units enables the hand to produce movements with very fine
spatiotemporal resolution. Paradoxically, however, the well-known
signal-dependent noise in models of motor output has been found to be
higher for hand muscles than for more proximal muscles, likely due to
small numbers of motor units compare to larger
muscles\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-fuglevandMechanicalPropertiesNeural2011}{7},\protect\hyperlink{ref-harrisSignaldependentNoiseDetermines1998}{8}}.

Muscle fibers are contained within muscle compartments, and each muscle
may have one or more compartments. The fingers of the hand are extended
by the extensor digitorum (ED) which contains four compartments, one for
each of the tendons the muscle produces. Each tendon connects to the
three metaphalangeal joints of each digit. The fingers are flexed by two
muscles, the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and the flexor
digitorum profundus (FDP). Like the ED, these muscles produce four
tendons, one to each finger from each of their four compartments. As
such, one must coactivate these agonist and antagonist muscles in order
to extend or flex a single finger in
isolation\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-fuglevandMechanicalPropertiesNeural2011}{7}}.
Adduction and Abduction of the fingers is produced by the 19 instrinsic
muscles of the hand, each of which has their origin and insertion points
within the hand
itself\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanduinenConstraintsControlHuman2011}{9}}.
The instrinisc muscle tendons form a kind of network around each of the
digits.

The human hand, thumb, and forearm system contains more than 30 muscles
and at least 20 degrees of freedom are theoretically available for
actuation. However, due to biomechanical coupling, the effective degrees
of freedom is presumably less than 20. One study found that tendons of
the fingers are arranged in such a way as to perform a kind of
anatomical computation which expands the mechanical capabilities of the
appendage by sharing force across its tendon
network\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-Valero-Cuevas2007}{10}}.
Such computations embedded in the musculoskeletal structure are
additional complexity when theorizing about neural control of the hand.

We believe this structure exists in order to facilitate the acquisition
of new skills and the generalization of existing skills to new contexts.
While the anatomy of the hand and forearm presents constraints on
movement, the system remains capable of producing a incredible variety
of movement
patterns\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-yanUnexpectedComplexityEveryday2020}{11},\protect\hyperlink{ref-Basmajian1963}{12}}\footnote{In
  a classic study, Basmajian and colleagues showed that it is possible
  to activate single motor units in the thumb abductor.}. The structure
of the neuromuscular system that underlies this variety offers many
clues as to the relevant computations required for dexterous movement.

\hypertarget{coordinative-structures}{%
\subsection{Coordinative Structures}\label{coordinative-structures}}

\begin{quote}
\emph{We have some idea as to the intricate design of the puppet and the
puppet strings, but we lack insight into the mind of the puppeteer.}

--- Bizzi \& Ajemian, \emph{2020}
\end{quote}

Nikolai Bernstein coined the phrase ``the degrees-of-freedom problem''
to describe the challenge the motor system faces in coordinating its
many dimension to achieve a goal. Solving this problem requires
dexterity.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bernstein1967}{5}} As
we have seen, redundancy is present from joints and muscles to motor
units and their upstream synaptic partners. However, rather than asking
how the motor control system deals with this ``problem'' overwhelming
complexity, we might instead question why this complexity is
evolutionarily advantageous at all. What does the availability of this
redundancy afford the motor system? How does this redundancy enable
dexterous movement?

A considerable amount of discussion has focused on the existence of
synergies as a simplifying structure which allows the motor system to
``solve'' the redundancy ``problem''. The term motor synergy can be used
descriptively to describe the spatiotemporal coactivation of muscles
necessary for an ongoing task. Synergetic control implies control in the
space of a low-dimensional set of synergy weights rather than
independent control over the actuator dimensions themselves. The control
dimensions are functionally coupled as a result of synergetic action,
which both simplifies the control task and constrains behavior to the
low-dimensional subspace defined by the synergy
weights\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-merelHierarchicalMotorControl2019}{13}}.
This is what Bizzi and colleagues refer to as ``the puppet's strings''.
The term can also be used as a normative model of motor coordination
which implies a constraint in the dimensionality of the descending
supraspinal control signal, the simplifying movements of the puppeteer.

Many studies have contributed to the concept of synergies as a
hard-wired organizing feature of the motor
system\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-DAvella2003}{14}}.\footnote{I
  should really have more studies here, or a really nice review.}
However, these works tend to extrapolate from non-primate preparations,
particularly in the frog, and use tasks which are inherently
low-dimensional to explain covariance structure in primate and human
kinematic and electromyography
data\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-giszterMotorPrimitivesNew2015}{15},\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gao2017}{\textbf{Gao2017?}}}.
That said, it would be foolish to deny the existence of synergistic
muscle coactivation even at the structural level. Careful studies of
force control by the fingertips present a complex story of
dimensionality of control in this
regime.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-raczSpatiotemporalAnalysisReveals2013}{16}}
Constraints exist in the architecture of the hand as well as its control
system, though we maintain that concept of synergies, especially in the
context of dexterous movement, is often presented as an
oversimplification rather than a mere simplification. We believe the
story of the hand is more complex.

Studies have attempted to quantify the number of effective degrees of
freedom of the hand with various methods. This has primarily been taken
to be the number of linear features which contain a desired level of the
original signal variance, where the signal is the joint angles of the
hand engaged in various
behaviors\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ingram2009}{17},\protect\hyperlink{ref-TodorovDimensionality2005}{18}}.
These methods have resulted in roughly 8 linear features of hand
kinematics to solve a variety of tasks, with subtleties found in
inter-task and inter-subject variations.\^{}{[}It has been argued that
the motor repertoire is hardly high-dimensional when compared to the
dimensionality of the visual feature extraction
system\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-yanUnexpectedComplexityEveryday2020}{11}}.
A recent study found that low-variance linear, kinematic components
displayed significantly higher correlation within condition (e.g.~grasp
of a specific object) than across condition. This suggests that these
components carry task-dependent information rather than
condition-independent, task-irrelevant
noise\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-yanUnexpectedComplexityEveryday2020}{11}}.
This suggests that the control of the hand is more nuanced than a set of
fixed synergies.

What Bizzi and colleagues call ``the problem of supraspinal pattern
formation''--how synergies are activated through time-- we argue, in the
context of hand control, is not simplified by the existence of
hard-wired or soft-wired
synergies\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-bizziMotorPlanningExecution2020}{19}}.
The CNS produces control signals in a range of contexts and in response
to continually changing task demands. Rather than the CNS ``simplifying
movement'' through synergetic action, it is more likely that hand
synergies fall out of a optimization strategy which trades off effort
and accuracy where effort may, in part, correspond to independent
control of individual control dimensions. If we limit ourselves to
synergetic control, then we have simply passed the problem to a
lower-dimensional one of the same fundamental nature. Neural control of
the hand likely contains a spectrum of modularity in order to maintain
its role as a flexible instrument. Synergetic action is one end of this
spectrum resulting from the computation and structure of the human
movement machine.

\hypertarget{fractionating-structures}{%
\subsection{Fractionating Structures}\label{fractionating-structures}}

At the other end of the spectrum, years of research has contributed to a
more complex picture of hand function which embraces non-synergistic
movement\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-lemon1993}{20}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-lemon2008}{22}}.
The key insight of the work is that while ``the organization of the
spinal cord is based on relatively rigid muscular modes, a mechanism to
fractionate this is of particular importance for the muscles of the
hands and digits which may need to be employed in a variety of flexible
associations during voluntary movements.'' Careful anatomical work has
shown how monosynaptic corticospinal, or corticomotoneuronal (CM),
connections provide such fractionation in primates which use tools
requiring
dexterity\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-lemonStartingStoppingMovement2019}{23}}.
M connections are specific to the primate corticospinal tract and
specific to distal muscles of the hands and arm. It appears that the
rodent CST contains CM connections until they recede around P10 at which
point they
recede\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-kawasawa2017}{24},\protect\hyperlink{ref-murabe2018}{25}}.

Just as many muscle fibers may be innervated by a single AMN, up to
thousands of neurons contact single AMNs through CM connections or a
variety of spinal interneuron circuits. The hallmark of CM connections
is their influence over multiple muscle compartments as well as multiple
muscles, though typically agonist or antagonist
sets\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-cheneyFunctionalClassesPrimate1980}{26}}.
This may seem counter-intuitive as a means to produce individuated
movement, but experimental evidence in primates has show that the
convergence of many CM collateral fibers onto single AMNs driving the
distal muscles in particular can produce a fine grading of activity over
motor units driving the distal joints. CM cells also appear to play a
role in the inhibition of antagonist muscles prior to contractions
required for
movement.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-griffinMotorCortexUses2020}{27}}
These findings confirm theories about the excitatory and inhibitory role
of these connection dating back decades, and combine to suggest that
variables encoded in cortical ensembles are more complex than kinematics
or dynamics
alone.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-cheneyFunctionalClassesPrimate1980}{26}}.

The CM tract thus acts in coordination with synergistic muscle
activations of the hand to achieve control that is balanced between
modularity and flexibility. Findings suggest that there is a bipartite
structure in human motor cortex driving dexterous control of the distal
part of the upper limb which, it has been suggested, evolved under
pressure to quickly generalize between tasks. This work argues that
these two streams of hand control, namely ``fractionated'' and
``synergistic'' control, may interact to produce versatility, and
balancing these subsystems may be a key part of the optimization
function when learning new
skills\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-Rathelot2009}{28}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-Takei2017}{30}}.
This dualism is likely not rigidly dichotomous, but rather a spectrum of
overriding fractionation (so-called ``New M1'') atop a phylogenetically
older system of synergistic
action\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-dumCorticospinalSystemStructural2011}{31}}.
Griffin and colleagues found that CM cells are functionally tuned to a
muscle's mode of activity (agonist, antagonist, fixator) to ``bypass
spinal cord mechanisms and sculpt novel patterns of motor output that
are essential for highly skilled
movements''.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-griffinCorticomotoneuronalCellsAre2015}{29}}

The degree to which fractionation of movement is learned is unknown.
Skilled piano performers have been found to exhibit a higher degree of
independent movement among the fingers compared to control participants.
Control groups displayed a hierarchical, presumably lower dimensional,
organization of finger movement patterns while pianists showed distinct
but individuated movement
patterns\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-furuyaFlexibilityMovementOrganization2013}{32}}.
These results are imply that with skilled practice humans can produce
finer and more independent movements of the fingers, and construct
bespoke coactivations to solve specific goals. Similarly, studies have
found that coherence between the index finger and thumb is greater on
the dominant hand. This might imply a developmental lateralization, but
use-dependent plasticity due to greater precision grip behavior of the
dominant hand is also a viable
explanation\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-fuglevandMechanicalPropertiesNeural2011}{7}}.

The concept of a balanced control may prove to be a fruitful direction
for theoretical work on dexterous motor control, the goal being to
construct a model which takes into account this spectrum of
individuation into account. The experimental challenge is to identify
tasks which ostensibly require the direct descending connections to
fractionate learned synergies. There is work suggesting that CM
connections synapse primarily on low threshold, low force motor units
that are recruited first. This would imply a difference in synergy
fractionation at lower force as opposed to higher force. This can be
tested easily by including a force parameter in a hand control task. The
hypothesis stemming from the previously described work is that CM
connections override the ``consolidated'' patterns putatively generated
via spinal interneuron circuitry.

\hypertarget{supraspinal-motor-maps}{%
\subsection{Supraspinal Motor Maps}\label{supraspinal-motor-maps}}

It is known from recent work that primary motor cortex (M1) is not an
isolated movement-generating dynamical system, but rather a node in the
network of a feedback-modulated, distributed movement machine. This is
reflected in recent work in the rodent which suggests that task-relevant
movement depends on these network
connections.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-sauerbreiCorticalPatternGeneration2019}{4}}
This finding is relevant for our purposed as it demonstrates a
fundamental function for cortical input as opposed to a specific
substructure of motor cortex as detailed above in the primate
literature.

Thinking structural architecture of M1 as an input-driven system with
outputs along a spectrum of modularity from synergistic to fractionated,
we can then ask what kind of functional architecture might have evolved
in the neuromuscular controller? Graziano and colleagues found that
500ms electrical stimulation to M1 reliabaly produced stereotyped
movements in primates, shown in
\cref{fig:rathelot_graziano}\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-grazianoORGANIZATIONBEHAVIORALREPERTOIRE2006}{33}}.
These movements appeared to produce goal-oriented actions pulled out of
other contexts such as bringing food to the mouth, and seemed to be
arranged on the cortical sheet topographically in terms of spatial
endpoints rather than as a homonculus. Graziano refers to this as the
cortical ``action map'', that these stimulations tapped into the control
mechanisms of the primate's motor
system\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-grazianoIntelligentMovementMachine2009}{34}}.

\begin{figure}

}
\end{figure}

Recent work identifying movement syllables on a behaviorally relevant
timescale has a similar flavor. Along with behavioral syllables, the
motor map concept posits the idea that M1 might be looked at like a
field of feedback control microcircuits, integrating and transforming
inputs, both internal and external, to sculpt ongoing
movement.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-wiltschkoMappingSubSecondStructure2015}{35}}
This is in accordance with the idea that there is a structural hierarchy
in M1 covering a spectrum of movement modularity. These ideas together
form a picture of the motor system as a structural scaffold upon which
behaviorally relevant feedback mappings from cortex to the spinal cord
are continuously activated and modulated based on information and
estimates about the periphery. In this view, the encoded variables of
interest depend on the goals, context, and perturbations of the intended
movement. Graziano writes:

\begin{quote}
``The usefulness of a feedback-dependent mapping from cortex to muscles
is that it can in principle allow neurons in motor cortex to control a
diversity of movement variables, such as direction, speed, hand
position, or posture that transcend a fixed pattern of muscle
activation. If the network receives feedback information about a
specific movement variable, then it can learn to control that
variable.''
\end{quote}

Muscle activity is, in a sense, a readout from a network transforming
state-dependent inputs into movement goals. Rather than playing chords,
the motor system is improvisational jazzmaster. The movement machine
wields its complexity to construct a movement fit to purpose, to suit
its context and the information it receives. Rather than choosing muscle
patterns in reconfigurable blocks, it creatively constructs and sculpts
movements. That is, the hierarchy of the motor system is not rigidly
organized around a particular set of variables. Many loops exist
connecting cortex with the spinal cord, the cerebellum, the basal
ganglia, and the sensorimotor periphery. Each of these loops contributes
information to flexible activate the relevant action maps. Prevailing
theory suggests that cerebellar loops provide predictive state
information while basal gangliar loops provide state and/or action value
information.

The movement machine reasons in the space of feedback control systems
and their ensuing trajectories. The phenomenal thing about the motor
system is that it is able to tune itself rapidly with both
high-dimensional sensory inputs and sparse reward
signals\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-bahlNeuralDynamicPoliciesfor2020}{36},\protect\hyperlink{ref-ijspeertDynamicalMovementPrimitives2013}{37}}.
This has some precedence in the literature and will be discussed further
in \cref{sec:theory}. This section has attempted to illustrate the
complexity of the motor control system specifically with regard to
dexterous control of the hand, with an eye toward experimental and
theoretical avenues for exploration. The goal is to build and test a
theoretical scheme for aspects of the compositional nature of the neural
hand controller.

joint angles directly to virtual stimuli, though few are focused on the
learning process and none have the input dimensionality we aim to
achieve in work proposed here.

takehome: humans are really good at learning tasks like these,
especially with their hands. this type of dexterity is specific to
primates if not humans. let's use this ability to understand and try to
model how this learning process unfolds.

\textbf{\emph{What does this give us that a force-field reaching task
can't?}}

\hypertarget{high-dimensional-emg-feedback}{%
\subsection{High-Dimensional EMG
Feedback}\label{high-dimensional-emg-feedback}}

Electromyography is the detection of changes in chemical potential using
electrodes. In my setup, we use a total 64 monopolar surface electrodes
and monopolar needle electrodes to record chemical potentials from
muscles in the forearm and hand.

The goal of the project's first phase is to develop a high-dimensional
surface EMG recording rig to generate datasets with high signal-to-noise
ratio and dense coverage over superficial muscles of the arm and hand.
The first question of this phase is: what are the limitations of a
closed-loop myocontrol experiment, and how can such constraints be
avoided or leveraged? To answer this question we will develop a signal
processing pipeline and diagnostics suite to identify constraints in the
setup and aim to overcome, as much as possible, the limitations inherent
in surface EMG recording such as muscle crosstalk and rigorous electrode
placement.

Francois Hug. Can muscle coordination be precisely studied by surface
electromyography? Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology,
21(1):1--12, February 2011.

The concept of the experimental setup is shown in Figure 1, where 64
monopolar electrodes are attached to a subject's arm and hand to record
muscle activity. The arm and hand are kinematically constrained in a
custom fixture and motor activity is recorded during isometric muscle
contractions at levels less than 20\% maximum voluntary contraction to
lessen the risk of involuntary co-contractions. The setup circumvents
the limb biomechanics by mapping muscle output directly to virtual
stimuli shown on a computer monitor. Additionally, our study focuses on
low-force, isometric contractions to avoid complications due to
artifacts in dynamic, high- force movements. We chose 64 channels in
order to have at least two electrodes per muscle implicated in control
of the hand in the event that we require differential recording. This
choice limits our analysis to the motor pool level. If our questions
require recording at the motor unit level, we will need to move to a
higher channel count system. Literature in this field typically use a
much lower number of channels. We believe that using 64 electrodes will
help develop a more complete picture of the superficial muscle activity
of the arm and hand across learning. A diagram of muscles relevant to
thee control of the hand and wrist is shown in Figure 2 on page 4. We
are not aware of a rigorous study testing which muscles of the arm and
hand can be accurately captured using surface EMG.

The second question of this phase is: what is the manifold of activity
in electrode space during natural hand use? To answer this question, we
will record naturalistic activity by subjects completing a set protocol
that covers the naturalistic space of electrode covariance. For
comparison, we will record a dataset of naturalistic tasks using a
separate, mobile setup with the same electrode placement pattern but
without the isometric constraint. These datasets could be collected from
a range subjects going throughout their daily tasks, or using a specific
set of tasks in the laboratory such as handwriting and the use of
various tools. Encouragingly, a recent review noted that ``Similarly to
the breakthroughs in understanding vision that followed the
quantification of statistics of natural scenes, a clear description of
the statistics of natural tasks might revolutionize our understanding of
the neural basis of high-level learning and decision- making''{[}18{]}.
By analyzing the structure of these naturalistic datasets, we can
compute the dimensionality of naturalistic movement as a subspace within
our electrode space, similar to work done using joint angles of the
hand{[}24, 22, 11{]}. From this work we know that while the hand has 29
joints and is controlled by 34 muscles, the dimensionality of natural
hand movements is closer to 8 in joint angle dimension space based on
principle components analysis. This analysis will also help us determine
the biomechanical constraints on hand output dimensionality. We
hypothesize that this will be higher than 8 and lower than 23, which
gives us a large task space to work with for generating learning tasks.
We aim to extend this prior work using learning algorithms that take
into account time- varying dynamics of the signal in addition to common
tools like components analysis and matrix factorization. This analysis
will help generate an understanding of intersubject, intersession, and
intertask variability. Both an analysis of dynamic correlations and a
validation of dimensionality using EMG would be a novel contribution to
the literature. We anticipate that quantifying electrode placement and
calibrating across sessions will be a major challenge. We aim to develop
a mechanical fixture for recording as well as alignment tools to aid in
placing electrodes in precisely the same location each session. Properly
separating variability due to electrode placement from behavioral and
physiological variability will be paramount to establish repeatability
in our results. Once we have collected a naturalistic activity dataset,
we can begin to design bespoke feedback mappings and perturbations, as
discussed in Section .

Goal here is to use the linear dynamics environment to isolate the
control strategies of the CNS under these constraints-- how does the CNS
adapt to this environment? How does it construct solutions to control
problems of various dimensionalities? How does it produce dexterous
responses to perturbations of these solutions?

This requires first mapping the intrinsic available dynamics of the hand
per user.

We then would like to present fixed mappings between hand output (either
through direct muscle activity or through a controller such as a force
pad).

\hypertarget{unsupervised-feature-extraction}{%
\subsection{Unsupervised Feature
Extraction}\label{unsupervised-feature-extraction}}

We want to determine a redundant control space from data taken during
natural activity. The difficulty with this is that such a natural
activity manifold may display spatial (channel-wise) correlations that
are possibly physiologically separable. Thus, there are two aims which
must be addressed separately:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Expore subjects' ability to decorrelate descending output to the
  muscles which have been shown to be correlated in a natural activity
  dataset.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Such a structured exploration might provide support for the
    hypothesis that ``synergies'' are flexible correlations between
    muscles driven by task demands rather than (or in addition to)
    physiological structure. This needs to be done incredibly carefully
    to escape criticism of hard-wired synergy enthusiasts.
  \item
    See \emph{de Rugy 2012} for a critique of OFC and hard-wired
    synergies
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Use common correlated outputs to develop a family of BMI-type learning
  tasks as a proxy for a ``novel skill'', then track motor planning of
  this new skill to compare with motor planning algorithms.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We might be able to get \#1 for free by going after this goal if
    we're careful in the setup
  \item
    This is arguably a more impactful focus as it connects low-level
    motor hierarchy data (EMG) to high-level planning with a normative
    hypothesis.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Electrode data from a single trial of a single session is held in a data
matrix \(X\) (n\_electrodes, n\_samples), and we wish to find a latent
weight matrix \(W\) (n\_electrodes, n\_components) which reconstructs
\(X\) by projecting latent trajectories \(H\) (n\_components,
n\_samples) into electrode space:

\[
X = W\cdot{H}
\]

\(H\) is the activity of the latent processes, and \(W\) is there mixing
matrix. The columns of \(W\) are the principal vectors spanning the
latent subspace in electrode space. If we have new samples, we can
project these new points onto this subspace:

\[
h_{new} = W^T\cdot{w_{new}}
\]

To justify this decomposition, we have to make some assumptions about
the nature of the EMG signal, namely that the signal is linear
instantaneous (each EMG sample can be instantly mapped to control
space). The other assumption is that the basis \(W\) should be
orthonormal, that the columns of \(W\) are orthogonal with unity norm.
This ensures that the left inverse \(W^{-1}\) is equal to the transpose
\(W^T\) such that:

\[
X &= W\cdot{H} \\
W^{-1}\cdot{X} &= {H} \\
W^{T}\cdot{X} &= {H}
\]

See \emph{Muceli 2014} for use of the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse in
place of the transpose when the columns of \(W\) do not form an
orthonormal basis. This would be the case for NMF. Is there a
factorization that produces nonnegative, orthogonal coordinates? Or is
the pseudoinverse okay? I will need to test this.

Stated in an information theoretic way, we want to minimize the
reconstruction loss \(\mathcal{L}\) for our derived encoder-decoder pair
(\(E\),\(D\)). We're decoding high dimensional activity into its latent
dimensions, and encoding back into the high dimensional space. :

\[
\min_{E,D}{\mathcal{L}\left[X - EDX\right]}
\]

This way, forget about orthonormality and solve for an encoder and
decoder directly. That is, \(E\neq{D}\) is perfectly acceptable.

Each row of \(D\) might be called a \textbf{spatial filter}, a linear
combination of electrode activities into a surrogate, hopefully more
intuitive space.

In general to find such a basis we must :

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Extract ``natural activity manifold'' from freeform data
\item
  Use features of this natural subspace to derive control mapping

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Linear iid features:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      PCA
    \item
      dPCA
    \item
      NMF
    \item
      ICA
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Linear time-dependent features:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      SSA
    \item
      LDS model / PGM
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Nonlinear

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      autoencoders
    \item
      networks
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The behaviors present in our calibration dataset are crucial, as they
determine the spatial correlations used to generate the mapping. If only
complex, multi-muscle movements are present in the calibration, it will
be impossible to decode subtle movements involving few muscles.
Additionally, because extraction is unsupervised, it will be impossible
to know how to alter the control basis directions (if we wish to do so)
such that they involve single muscles or the smallest sets of muscles.

Ultimately, we want to find reproducible features in our data that are
due to muscle coordination alone, rather than volitional movements. We
want the lowest level covariance that reflects physiology rather than a
task-level behavioral description (see \emph{Todorov, Ghahramani 2005}
and \emph{Ingram, Wolpert 2009}). The idea is that if we collect data
from enough tasks, we can extract the common modes of muscle activity.
This is true only if we are sampling uniformly from the space of tasks.
Otherwise one task, and therefore one coordination pattern, will be
overrepresented.

\hypertarget{task-formalization}{%
\subsection{Task Formalization}\label{task-formalization}}

In this task, the subject's first goal is to interact through an unknown
visuomotor mapping and internalize this model. The second problem is to
use this model to solve a control problem.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  System Identification -- learning a transition function
  \(p(y_t|x_t, u_t)\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    How do you learn the unknown observation model from data?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Policy Optimization

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Once dynamics are learned (or at least stable?), how do we form a
    policy that is generalizable to new tasks under these dynamics?
  \item
    This is the control problem.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

It's safe to assume that these processes are happening in parallel.
Because we have complete and arbitrary control over the observation
mapping, we can ask the subject to interact through a dynamic that is
intuitive (informative prior) or unintuitive (uninformative or
inhibitive prior). Each scenario, we hypothesize, will elicit different
strategies for learning and control.

The unknown mapping \(M\) from muscle to task space looks like the
observation matrix \(H\) in the LQG problem:

\[
\begin{align*}
y_t &= Hx_t + v_t\,\,\,(\mathrm{LQG}) \\
y_t &= Mx_t + v_t. \,\,\,(\mathrm{experiment})
\end{align*}
\]

The state dynamics in the task are of the form:

\[
\begin{align*}
x_{t} &= Ax_{t-1} + Bu_{t-1} + w_{t-1} \,\,\,(\mathrm{LQG}) \\
x_t &= Dx_{t-1} + Iu_{t-1} + w_{t-1} \,\,\,(\mathrm{experiment})
\end{align*}
\]

where \(D\) is a diagonal decay matrix of with terms
\(\mathrm{e}^{-\lambda}\) and \(I\) is the identity. The subject
produces muscle contractions which add to the current latent
(unobserved) state. In the absence of control signals, the state decays
back to \(0\) in line with the physics of your arm returning to a
passive state in the absence of muscle contractions. The terms \(w\) and
\(v\) are gaussian noise vectors with distributions \(\mathcal{N}(0,Q)\)
and \(\mathcal{N}(0,R)\). If we combine the transition and observation
models:

\[
\begin{align*}
y_t &= MDx_{t-1} + Mu_{t-1} + Mw_{t-1} + v_t \\
&= A^\prime x_{t-1} + B^\prime u_{t-1} + Mw_{t-1} + v_t.
\end{align*}
\]

We can think of this as the combined system identification problem where
\(A^\prime=MD\) and \(B^\prime=M\) are unknown and must be estimated.
The noise covariances of this altered system are now non-trivial,
however. We could also assume that the transition dynamic \(D\) is known
and that the identification problem is learning the mapping \(M\) only.
This might not be a poor assumption since the exponential decay is meant
to serve as an intuitive passive dynamic.

In each trial of the task, a subject will have some internal
representation of the observation dynamic \(M\) which may or may not be
accurate. In order to make accurate predictions, \(M\) must be
estimated.

Learning linear dynamical systems from data is a hot topic of research,
most of which seems to focus on learning in the context of complete
state observation (\(M=I\), \(y=x\)). Algorithms to determine parameters
of \(A\) and \(B\) are proposed (see Dean, Recht 2018).

From LQG theory we know that the control law is a linear function of the
state:

\[
\begin{align*}
u_t = -L_tx_t
\end{align*}
\]

and thus our combined system dynamic is:

\[
\begin{align*}
y_t &= M(D-L_t)x_{t-1} + Mw_{t-1} + v_t.
\end{align*}
\]

The noise covariance due to the observation Q is unchanged, but the new
noise covariance for the latent process is now \(MRM^T\). This may make
things difficult.

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{model-based-reinforcement-learning}{%
\subsubsection{Model-based Reinforcement
Learning}\label{model-based-reinforcement-learning}}

Since we only have an approximate model of the system dynamic, we could
simply work towards an optimal policy directly using gradient
derivative-free optimization methods in a model-free approach. Since we
have good evidence that humans leverage internal models to make
decisions (at least in a motor problem domain), we need to define an
algorithm which uses past observations and controls to update our
approximation for the system dynamic. Here is a very general algorithm:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{-1}
\tightlist
\item
  Define a base policy/controller and base system model (\(L_0\) and
  \(\hat{M}_0\))
\item
  Collect samples (by interacting with the true environment
  \(M_{true}\)) using the current policy/controller (collect
  \(y_t,u_t,y_{t+1}\) triples using \(L_i\) for \(i \in \{0\dots N\}\)
\item
  Use sample(s) / trajectories to update current system dynamical model
  \(\hat{M}_i\)
\item
  Update current policy/controller \(L_i\) (using the system dynamics or
  using a direct policy method)
\end{enumerate}

If the true system dynamics were known, we could solve the Algebraic
Riccati Equation with a backwards pass, and compute our controls in a
forward pass. This general algorithm structure highlights how the
(unknown) system identification and controller design are intertwined:
identifying a system appropriately must rely on sampling and fitting
regions of the state space pertinent to adequate control in terms of
cost (Ross ICML 2012). Otherwise, our approximation to the true system
dynamic will only produce a valid controller in regions we have
previously explored. The question is how we can effectively (sample and
time efficiently) utilize new state transitions we encounter either
online as feedback or between trials to update our model and policy.
That is, the number of trials and/or trajectories to use before updating
either the system model and/or policy is an important parameter.

In the LQG setting, this might be called ``adaptive LQG''.
